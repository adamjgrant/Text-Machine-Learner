Ciliegine Con Prosciutto

Small, cherry-sized balls of cow's milk mozzarella, packed in sealed 
plastic containers are available in the dairy section of many supermarkets 
or speciality stores.

1/2 medium lemon
1 medium garlic clove
2 tbl snipped fresh chives
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 tsp hot red-pepper flakes
9 ounces fresh mozzarella "cherries" or fresh mozzarrella
15 thin prosciutto slices (6 ounces) If you can find Parma it's
worth the extra money.
1 medium bunch dill

Squeeze lemon juice into a medium bowl.  Peel and crush garlic and put
it into the bowl along with the chives, olive oil, and red-pepper
flakes.  Drain and add cheese "cherries" or cut mozzarella into 3/4-
inch cubes and add to the mixture.  Marinate at room temperature at
least 2 hours. (Can cover and refrigerate overnight).  Cut
prosciutto slices in half lengthwise.  Wrap 1 slice of
prosciutto around each piece of cheese and 1 small sprig of dill.
Secure with a toothpick and serve. Let me know if you want any
others.  I have many.  Or if it is something special you
are looking for.  I would be happy to help you knock the
socks off of your aunt.


Baked Brie

Also, baked Brie is fabulous.  If you want to get fancy with the brie, 
saute some mushrooms with tarragon, garlic and a bit of wine until the 
mixture is almost dry (the mushrooms should be sliced or chopped, by the
by), take a wheel of brie, slice it in half, put the mushroom mix in the 
middle, and wrap it in phyllo or puff pastry (the frozen puff pastry works 
fine).  Put in the freezer for 20 minutes to firm everything up.  

At this point, it can be moved to the fridge and kept until needed.  Bake 
it in a moderate oven until the puff pastry browns.  Let sit for 15-20 
minutes before cutting.

You can also use puff pasty scraps to cut out little leaves and stuff to put
on top of the whole thing for decoration.  This is best with the small wheels,
about 5 inches in diameter.


Shrimp wrapped in pea pods

Steam the peas so they're limp.  Boil and peel the shrimp, leaving the 
tails on.  Wrap each shrimp in a pea pod and skewer with a fancy toothpick 
to keep it on.  Have a couple of dipping sauces. 


 Puff Pastry Calzone with Chevre & Artichoke Hearts.

1 PKG frozen pastry shells (6), defrosted
8 oz. Chevre cheese, crumbled or feta cheese
1/4 cup cut up onion slices
8 ounces marinated artichoke hearts, drained & chopped
2 Tablespoons sliced black olives
grated paremasan cheese

Stack 3 pastry shells together & roll them out to measure 8" (this makes
a big one you can do it like this & have people cut off a slice or make
little ones).

Place pastry on a lightly greased cookie sheet.
                               
When you defrost shells don't let them get too soft - just so they are 
still chilled.

Combine the next 4 ingredients & place in center of pastry leaving a 1"
border along the edge.  (you can also add some garlic to the mixture)

Roll out the remaining shells in the same fashion & place over the filling.
Press & sel the edges with the tines of a fork.  Scallop them in a
decorative fashion.  Pierce top with fork & brush tip with a little water
& sprinkle with a little grated parmesan cheese.

You can either bake it now or put it in the fridge until the next day if
need be.

Bake in a 400 oven for about 25 minutes or until top is a deep golden brown.
place in a platter & cut into wedges to serve.  Serves about 6.

If you assemble this in advance that's fine but don't bake it until just
before serving.


Russian Stuffed Eggs

1 doz. large (jumbo) eggs
1/2 lbs large mushrooms
1 bunch parsly
ground black pepper
Mayonnaise (I used Cholestrol Free Kraft)

Boil the eggs for 10 minutes or more (until they're hard)
let them cool off completely.

Chop the mushrooms very finely (a good food processor will help) 
The goal is to have about 2 cups of chopped mushrooms for every
dozen eggs.

Chop 1/2 cup of parsly (very very fine, food processor type fine)

Cut the eggs in half and take out the yolks. Mix the egg yolks with 
the mushrooms, parsly and add a tea spoon full of black pepper. 

Add 1/2 cup mayonnaise and stir the whole thing. You should have a 
grey, mushroomy paste. 

Stuff each hollow egg half with heaping teaspoon of the paste. Put
a tiny little bit of mayo on top and stick a parsly leaf on.
Refrigerate before serving. 

Most people grabbed 3 - 4 halves, so plan accordingly. 
If you're handy around the kitchen, 3 dozens of this should not
take you more than 1 hour and you can prepare this hours ahead.


Boboli pizza

1  Boboli (Italian crust in the shape of pizza pre-made up)
   Pesto sauce
   sun dried tomatoes
   grated cheese (Monterey Jack works great)

Spread the pesto sauce on the boboli.  Lay the sun dried tomatoes on 
top (I laid them on paper towels to get some of the excess oil off).
Cover top with grated cheese.  Bake at 450 for 10 minutes or until 
cheese is melted.  Cut in diamond shapes, then cut shapes in half to 
get finger-sized triangles.  Serve warm.


Savory Egg Rolls: (makes around 56 small rolls)

 	1 Medium Carrot (Julienned)
 	6 - 8 Scallions (chopped)
	2 Medium Cloves of Garlic (crushed)
	1/2 Lb. White Mushrooms (chopped) or Shitake if you're from Palm Beach
	3/4 Lb. Spinach (stemmed and broken up)
	10 oz. Cooked Salmon (canned, or preferrably fresh)
	12 - 15 medium to large shrimp (peeled, deveined, and chopped)
	2 Tbsp. Chinese Cooking Wine or Dry Sherry
	2 Tbsp. Dark Soy Sauce (Kikkoman?)
	1 Lb. Package of Won Ton Wrappers
	About 1/2 Package of "White Sauce" mix (for thickener)
	Salt and Pepper to taste
	1 - 2 Cups Vegetable oil (for deep frying)

Filling Preparation:
In a fairly large sauce pan or fry pan, saute garlic, scallions, and carrot 
in a little oil until vegetables are limp. Add wine, soy sauce, spinach,
seafood and mushrooms and stir fry, while breaking up the salmon into
small pieces. Be careful not to overcook. Shrimp should turn pink and 
mushrooms and spinach should have rendered their liquid and gone soft.
Add some of the White Sauce mix a little at a time until good consitency
is reached, and ingredients stick together (like stuffing). Let this
mixture cool before making the rolls.

Stuffing and Frying:
Lay out a sheet of wax paper for a work area, and have within reach a saucer
with a little water. It's best to do three at a time, I found. Place about
a well rounded teaspoon of filling in the lower third of each Won Ton wrapper.
Then fold the two sides part way over the mixture. Wet your finger in
the saucer
and use it to moisten the top end of the wrapper. Roll it up and seal it.
For frying, put enough oil in the pan to just cover the rolls. Fry for 3-5
minutes each until golden brown. You can fry maybe 5-8 at a time depending
on the size of the pan. Turn each occasionally to check doneness and color.
Drain on paper towels.

Dipping Sauce:
This one goes well. Just mix about 2 Tbsps. of Grey Poupon (or similar)
mustard with 1 Tsp. honey and 1 Tbsp. dark soy sauce.

These are not so difficult to make as it may seem. The worst part is the
wrapping, but that might take only 15 minutes or so once you get adept
and have a little practice. These rolls reheat well by  low temp (325)
oven or microwave. Heat before serving, but they're OK at room temp.


Mini Quiche

Prepare a double batch of pie crust or purchase a pie crust
mix.  Roll out and cut in circles using a donut cutter or
cooking cutter.  Place circles into bottom of muffin pan so
that pie crust curls up the sides by about 1/4 inch.  Fill
with any combo of filling.  I used bacon, mushrooms, onions,
and swiss for one filling.  The other was broccoli, onions 
and cheddar cheese.  Place just enough filling so it does 
not go above lip of crust.  Beat 2 eggs and 3/4 cup sour
cream.  Spoon 1 teasp. of egg mixture over each quiche.

Bake for 20-25 min in 375 oven.  
Reheat defrosted quiche for 10 min in a 400 oven.


A Different sort of Rumaki....

Shrimp ( usually use the med size prawns, fresh is better)
*Pepper* Bacon (really really it makes a difference)
A full large head of garlic
several lemons and limes
1 -2 tsp dried red pepper

Peel and devein the shrimp. Marinate them with all the garlic (peeled
and crushed), the red pepper and enough of equal amounts
of fresh lime and lemon juice to cover all the shrimp. Marinate in
the 'fridge for 3-6 hours. I usually do this in the morning and let them
go all day.

After marinating, drain the shrimp (If you are grilling outside
I recommend that you save the marinade and baste with it) and cut the
bacon strips in half. Wrap the bacon around the shrimp and secure
with a toothpick. Either grill over mesquite basting with
the reserved marinade (the favored method) or broil in the oven. 
You may pre-grill these and refrigerate, then warm in the broiler
prior to serving. In fact, I think they even taste better that way!


Layered Bread Loaves

order loaves of bread from a bakery (or bake yourself if you're
really ambitious).  you can even ask them to make them in pastel
shades if you're so inclined.  just ask them to slice the bread
horizontally for you ... so you have about 5 or 6 long slices.
trim the crust and spread/stuff/fill with whatever you like.  i've
used pate, cream cheese (again, tinted if you want) with chopped
olives, cherries, nuts, whatever ... or you can use any one of the
prepared flavored cream cheeses in the supermarket.  roll up,
fasten with toothpicks, wrap first in saran, then in foil (the
saran keeps the foil from getting stuck to the rolls), and freeze
for an hour or so.  remove from the freezer an hour or so before
you're going to serve them and slice.  you have pretty little
pinwheel-looking things.


Mushroom sandwiches

this one takes a little longer.  chop up some fresh mushrooms and
onions, and saute in butter, margarine, oil, whatever until the
onions are clear.  drain and set aside until cool.  on cocktail
bread (rye or pumpernickel), pile a mound of mushrooms and onions,
grated swiss cheese, grated italian cheese (i use locatella), and
bread crumbs.  broil until the swiss melts, and serve immediately.



Filled Tortillas

6 flour tortillas (El Ranchito brand work best)
Salsa (optional)
1 pkg (12-16 oz) cream cheese (softened)
1 1/2 tbl chopped black olives (measurement is a guess)
4 jalipinios chopped fine (fresh are better than canned) (more or less to taste)
1/4-1/2 tsp chili powder
3/4 tsp Johnnys (or other) seasoning salt

Mix softened (can be done in the microwave) cream cheese, olives, jalipinos,
chili powder, and seasoning salt.  Spread a thin layer on tortilla going
all the way out to the edges.  Roll tortilla. Repeat for each tortilla.   
At this point you can either put them in a plastic bag in the refrigerator 
and save until you are ready to serve them, or serve immediately.
(Sometimes I warm them for a few seconds in the microwave to soften, other
times I serve cold). Cut into 1/2" slices before serving.  Can be dipped
into salsa.


	Crab Puffs
		1 pkg. wanton skins
		8 oz. cream cheese
		7 1/2 oz. crab
		2 tsp. soft breadcrumbs
		2 drops sesame oil

Combine all ingredients except skins.  Fill squares with 1 tsp. of the
mixture and fold over, making triangles.  Moisten to seal edges.  Fry
in oil heated to 370 F for 3 minutes, or until brown and puffed,
turning once.  Serve with Chinese mustard.


	Mexican Stuffed Mushrooms

		1 lb. hot sausage 
		1/3 c. soy sauce
		1 clove garlic
		2 lbs. LARGE mushrooms

Mix together the first 3 ingredients.  Stuff mushrooms.  Bake at 350 F
for 20 minutes or until sausage is done.


	Fresh Fruit Dip

		8 oz. cream cheese, softened
		1/2 c. lemon yogurt
		1/2 tsp. vanilla
		1/2 c. coconut, toasted
		3 tbl. milk

In a small mixer bowl beat together the cream cheese, lemon yogurt,
honey, and vanilla till smooth.  Stir in the coconut and milk.  Turn
into serving bowl.  Cover and chill in the refrigerator till cold.
Serve with slices of fresh fruit.



	Filo Dough Triangles

2 boxes (2 pounds) Filo pastry leaves
1 to 1+1/2 pounds unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
3 batches of FILLING(s) (see below)

Melt the butter.  Take a filo leaf, lay it out flat, and brush it
with melted butter.  Put another leaf on top of this one and butter
it as well.  Cut this into four long strips (the dough is usually
18x24, so when you cut it, you should get four 4.5x24 strips).  For
each strip, put a spoonful of filling at the top, and then flag-fold
the strip into a triangle with the filling inside.  Repeat until you
run out of either the filling or the filo leaves.

Slash the tops of the triangles -- be careful not to cut through to
the filling.

Bake these at 450 degrees F. for about twenty to twenty-five minutes.
(Basically, you just want to make them golden-brown.)


Roquefort-Leek filling

1/2 cup minced leeks (about two leeks)
3 tbsp butter
2 oz. Roquefort cheese
2/3 cup Ricotta cheese
1 egg-yolk
Salt and pepper if you want

Cut the green tops off the leeks;  discard.  Quarter the leeks down
their long axis, and rinse well in a pot of water.  Now mince finely.
Saut'e in the butter until tender.  Crumble the roquefort and mix in;
also stir in the ricotta.  If you really feel that you *must* add a
bit of salt, and you don't mind that it's going to ruin your blood
pressure, besides clogging your arteries with the cholesterol from
the butter and cheeses, (:-) then add some.  Same with the pepper. :-)

Mix well.  Fills up about 24-30 triangles.


Three-Cheese filling with Pepperoni

1/2 cup Ricotta cheese
3 tbsp grated mozzarella
3 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan
1/4 cup very finely chopped pepperoni
1 egg yolk
Salt and pepper if you want

Mix everything together.  Fills up about 24-30 triangles.


Crab filling

8 oz. fresh crab meat
3 tbsp butter
3 tbsp shallots, finely chopped
1 tbsp sherry
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
Salt and pepper if you want

Melt butter, saut'e shallots until soft but not browned.  Add the crab and
sherry, saut'e or 30 seconds.  Stir in the rest, let cool.  Fills up about
24-30 triangles.


Curried Lamb filling

8 oz lean boneless lamb
3 tbsp butter
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1-2 tsp curry powder
1/4 tsp ground coriander
a pinch of cayenne pepper
Salt and pepper if you want

Chop lamb into 1/4 inch pieces.  Melt 2 tbsp butter in a pan and brown
lamb over medium-high heat.  Move lamb to a bowl, and saut'e the onion,
garlic, curry, and coriander until soft.  Stir in lamb and season to
taste with salt, pepper, and cayenne.  Fills up about 24-30 triangles.


MEXICAN APPETIZER

1 (8 oz) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 jar thick and chunky picante sauce
1/2 jar dried beef, chopped
8-10 flour tortilla shells
1 C cheese, grated
Paprika

Mix cream cheese, picante sauce and dried beef until creamy. (You may
chop the dried beef in a food processor, then add the other two
ingredients and mix.) Place one tortilla shell on serving dish and
spread with a layer of the mixture.  Repeat this process until you have
a stack of 8 to 10 tortilla shells with cream cheese layers between.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.  Cut into wedges to
serve.  Sprinkle with grated cheese and paprika.  If desired, serve
with sour cream, guacamole, or extra picante sauce on the side.

The grated cheese can also be added to the cream cheese mixture rather
than sprinkled on top.


CRAB RANGOON

1 or 2 packages (8 ounces) Neufchatel cheese, softened (or cream cheese)
     {amount based on how "cheesy" you want them}
1 can (6 ounces) crab meat, drained and flaked
2 green onions including tops, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon lite soy sauce
1 package (48 count) won ton skins
vegetable spray coating

In medium bowl, combine all ingredients except won ton skins and spray
coating; mix until well blended. (To prevent won ton skins from drying
out, prepare one or two rangoon at a time.) Place 1 teaspoon filling in
center of each won ton skin. Moisten edges with water; fold in half to
form triangle, pressing edges to seal. Pull bottom corners down and
overlap slightly; moisten one corner and press to seal. Lightly spray
baking sheet with vegetable coating. Arrange rangoon on sheet and lightly
spray to coat. Bake in 425 degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until
golden brown. Serve hot with sweet-sour sauce or mustard sauce. 

Makes 48 appetizers.
NOTE: Rangoon can also be fried in oil. 


Spicy Phyllo Cups

1/3 cup raisins, chopped
1 T olive oil
1/2 pound rump steak, chopped (I used tenderloin)
black pepper
chives

Stack three sheets of phyllo dough on a work surface.  For cups, use a 
three inch round tart pan or mold to cut out circles, and then place 
the circles in 2 1/4" tart pans.  For boats, use a 4 1/2 x 2" boat-shaped 
tart mold as a guide and place the phyllo into 3 1/2 x 1 1/2" boat-shaped 
molds.  Cut out approximately 30 cups or boats.

Bake at 425 for 6-8 minutes.  They should be golden brown.  Remove carefully 
from the molds and cool on a wire rack.

Heat 1 T olive oil in a frying pan.  Cook onion over medium-low heat until 
soft but not browned (5-6 minutes).  Add the pine nuts the garlic, and the 
cumin, cardamom, cayenne, and cinammon.
Cook 2-3 minutes.  Add mushrooms and cook until soft.  Add raisins.
Transfer to a plate.

Heat 1 T olive oil in the frying pan.  Stir-fry the steak until it changes 
color.  Add the mushroom mixture and combine.  Season with pepper, and salt

Spring-Fresh Hors d'ovres

Endive leaves, separated
Cream cheese plus another cheese for flavoring (roquefort, goat,
	gruyere, or other cheese of your choice)
Fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, parsley combination is nice)
Garlic powder (just a bit)
Fresh chives (leave in their lengthy state; don't chop)
Smoked salmon
Red bell pepper

Chop some fresh herbs and set aside.  Process together cream
cheese and second cheese of your choice.  Now cream together in
a bowl the cheese mixture, herbs, and a bit of garlic powder to
taste.  (You may also add some salt, white ground black pepper,
or even cayenne pepper if you like.)  Put into a pastry bag and
fit with an attractive piping attachment (I use the "scallop edge"
attachment).  Pipe the cheese in a line along the length of the
endive "boat".  Do this until all endive leaves or cheese mixture
is used.  Now top off each by placing on top of the piped cheese
length:  1 strand of chive (cut shorter as necessary), a bit of
minced red bell pepper, and a small strip of smoked salmon.
Place all "boats" on a lined cookie sheet, cover with plastic
wrap, and refrigerate until ready to serve.  Very attractive
& quite artistic.


Sourdough Baguettes

A great little cafe in Reno (yeah, we don't all eat in casinos) serves
little sourdough baguette slices topped with, in order, cream cheese,
pesto sauce, and roasted red pepper slices, and its wild!!

My wife and I have made it a few times, and now that roasted red
peppers are readily available in jars from most supermarkets, it's a
pretty easy task. Just soften the cream cheese, spread a nice little
layer on the sourdough slice, then a dolop of your favorite pesto, and
a little slice of red pepper. People with an aversion to raw fish have
to be assured that the red pepper really is vegetal matter, and not
something of the sea, as it has an almost lox-like appearance.



	bacon and cream cheese stuffed mushrooms

8 oz. cream cheese, softened
4-6 strips of bacon, fried and crumbled; reserve fat
1 small onion, finely chopped
20-25 large mushrooms, stems removed
about 8 mushroom stems, finely chopped

saute onion and mushroom stems in bacon fat until tender. drain off excess
fat.  mix crumbled bacon, onion and stems with softened cream cheese until
the mixture is workable.

stuff each mushroom and bake at 350 deg. f for 10-15 minutes.
finish under the broiler just until tops are golden.


bstila - moroccan chicken/nut pie

brown 1/2 lb blanched almonds in a little oil until golden.  chop
coarsely or pound with a mortar and pestle.  add 1/2 tsp cinnamon
and (optionally) honey or sugar to sweeten to taste (anc adds none
but cites recipes calling for up to 1/2c sugar--i favor a little
honey as the contrast of the sweetness with the savory chicken is
part of the exotic appeal of the dish).  set aside.

heat 1 tbsp clarified butter and 1/3 cup butter in a large heavy 
pot.  add 1 minced medium onion and saute for a few minutes.  add 
chicken meat equivalent to about 1/2 chicken (e.g. two boneless 
breasts), cut in small pieces (as for a pot pie), along with:

1/2 tsp pepper
1 pinch saffron (or, per ongoing thread, 1/2 tsp turmeric)
1/2 tsp cinnamon
3/4 cup minced parsley
1/4 cup minced coriander (cilantro, chinese parsley)
salt to taste

simmer until the chicken is done.  beat 2 eggs and slowly stir them 
into the sauce.  remove from heat.

have ready phillo sheets, melted butter (at least 1/4 lb), and a pastry
brush.  select a shallow baking pan about 8" in diameter, such as an iron
skillet.  what you basically want to do is construct a pie by layering
the phillo sheets in the pan and then folding them over the contents; it
will probably be easiest if you cut the sheets in half or smaller, for
instance into long rectangles about the width of the pan and twice as long.
brush one of the sheets with melted butter, and put it, butter side up,
in the bottom of the pan, the excess dangling over the side.  add another
sheet, at an angle to the first, and repeat so that you have phillo
covering the bottom of the pan and dangling out all around (this is hard
to describe).  use about 5 sheets to form this layer.  repeat the process,
forming another layer.  now pour the chicken and sauce into the pan.  put
several more buttered sheets on top of the chicken, this time not
overlapping the edge--use smaller pieces or fold them in half.  spread
the nut mixture on top of this.  put another layer or so of phillo, then
fold the dangling ends over the top so as to close the envelope.  (your
mileage may vary on the number and details of layering the sheets).  brush
the top with butter.  at this point the bstila can be refrigerated if
desired (this is time-consuming and you may wish to do all this the day
before serving).

just before serving, put the pan in a 350-degree oven for 15-20 minutes
until the top is golden: flip it onto an oven-proof plate (or use an
ordinary plate to flip it over back into the skillet) and return to brown
the other side, 30-40 minutes total.  place on a serving platter, sprinkle
with powdered sugar, then make fanciful decorative designs with ground
cinnamon.  (when i had this in a restaurant it said something like "eat
me").

processor.  set aside.

clarify the shortening, and everything is ready to be put together now.

on the bottom of the pan used to roast the chicken, after washing and
greasing it, stack 2 sheets of filo dough, letting edges overhang.  brush on
top some of the clarified shortening.  at broil, rapidly brown these 2
sheets.  then add cubed chicken, with all spices and juice.  spread again 2
more dough sheets with some shortening brushed on.

broil rapidly.  add soft mixture of eggs with cilantro.  cover with 2 more
greased sheets.  broil rapidly.  add almonds mixed with cinnamon and sugar.

i like to set up an hors d'oeuvre party in three four stations:
one for hot and cold meat or fish nibbles, one for bread and cheese,
one for vegetable, and one fruit and desert.  then i may set out seasoned
popcorn, nuts, or wine crackers in small bowls around the room for
"instant gratification." i also have a "serve yourself" bar for
drinks of whatever kind i'm serving, usually a not-too-sweet punch
and soda, with wine or beer. (an excellent and pretty nonalcoholic punch
can be made with white grape juice, a good gingerale like canada dry or
schweppes, and a little pomegranate juice. to spike it, add brandy
to taste. if you like it sweeter, use framboise instead of the
pomegranate juice. or try creme de cassis.) in the winter, i may
make some mulled wine or cider.



Title: Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp
 
 
8    oz. Canadian-style bacon, cut in 12 slices
12  med. shrimp, shelled and deveined
1   med. red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 12 strips
1 1/2 T. low-sodium teriyaki sauce (I'd use regular)
1 1/2 T. low-sodium chili sauce (" " ")
1     T. hoisin sauce
 
1. Place bacon on rack; cover with paper towel.  Microwave on High 1
minutes; pat dry on paper towel.  Let cool slightly.
 
2. Wrap one shrimp and one pepper strip in each piece of bacon; secure
with wooden pick.  Place in 11x7" baking dish.
 
3. In small bowl, combine the teriyaki, chili and hoisin sauces with 2
T. water; pour over shrimp.  Cover and refrigerate 2 hours, turning
once.
 
4. Uncover and microwave on High 3-4 minutes, until shrimp is cooked
through.  Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
 

Chevre, Pear, Prosciutto, and Walnuts in Filo Bundles

3 pears, peeled, cored, and diced
12 oz. chevre
2 oz. prosciutto, sliced very thinly and julienned
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 tbl sage or pineapple sage, minced
1 pkg filo dough
1 cup butter, liquid
1 cup cream
garnish: chopped chives, 1 star fruit, 1 cucumber

Combine diced pears, 8 oz. chevre, julienned prosciutto, chopped walnuts,
and minced sage in a bowl. This is the filling.

Cut filo sheets in half so they are roughly square. You will use three
sheets, or six half sheets per serving, but you'd better count to be
sure you have enough. Lightly butter the bottoms of eight custard cups
or ramekins and place on a sheet pan. Lay six half-sheets, buttered with
a brush, over each other in a messy, offset pattern. Ease into a custard
cup. Repeat for all eight custard cups. Divide the filling among the
cups, placing it in the filo dough, and then twisting the tops into a
bundle over the filling. Brush the top lightly with butter. Bake the
bundles in a 350'F oven until nicely browned and the inside is hot,
about 20 minutes.

Combine 4 oz. chevre with 1 cup cream over moderate heat. Stir
vigorously to make the mixture smooth and reduce until the sauce coats a
spoon.

To serve, divide the sauce among eight salad-sized plates. Tilt the
plates to make the sauce evenly coat the inner area of the plate. Ease
the filo bundles out of the custard cups by loosening the edges with a
knife and then lifting it out with a spoon. Place a filo bundle in the
center of each plate.

Optional garnish: Sprinkle snipped chives on the sauce on the bottom half of
the plate. On the top half of the plate, place a thin slice of star fruit
on the right and a cucumber fan on the left.

See any book on garnishing for cucmber fan instructions. A cucumber fan is
made by slicing a cucumber in half lengthwise, cutting grooves in the skin
with a citrus zester/groove tool, and then making four thin slices cut at
a 45' angle, but held together in one corner. The fan is mooshed on to
the plate to make an ornamental fan. If you have a very sharp knife and a
steady hand, it's really quite easy.

                CRISP SAUTEED MUSHROOMS 


1 # large whole fresh mushrooms
these mushrooms must be absolutely fresh and the caps should
not be separating from the stems.

brush off mushrooms and slice into 1/4" slices from the
top down, including the stems.

with a fine mist spray bottle, mist the mushrooms to just barely
dampen.

drop into a paper bag or large ziplock bag that contains 1 or 2 cups
of a/p flour.  stir well or shake very gently.  then, let the mushrooms
"marinate" for a while in the flour while you prepare to cook them.

in a large, well seasoned cast-iron skillet or a commercial quality non-
stick skillet melt 1/2 stick of fresh unsalted butter and ~1/4 cup of
olive oil.  mix the oils well and heat to ~300-325 degrees.

drop the mushrooms into a colander to remove excess flour.  drop a few
at a time into the butter/oil and coat each well.  continue 'til all the
mushrooms are in the skillet.  turn down the heat to the saute level
and continue to cook, turning frequently.  after a few minutes add salt
and pepper to taste.

continue to cook until the degree of crispness is achieved.

my neighbor used to cook these for a long time, rendering nearly all the
moisture out of the mushrooms.  the finished product would be the most
delicate, and crisp mushrooms used as a side vegetable.



                   pate a chou (profiteroles)
 
1/2 c. water                       1/2 c flour
1/4 c. butter                      3 eggs
 
     place water and butter in a medium saucepan, heat until
water boils and the butter is melted. remove from the heat and
dump in the flour all at once.  stir vigorously until the flour
mixture forms an elastic ball in the saucepan. let the dough
mixture cool, and then beat in an egg until it is fully
incorporated into the dough mixture.  repeat the process with
each of the remaining eggs, beating them into the dough, one at a
time. 
     place the dough in the refrigerator to cool, for at least 45
minutes to 1 hour.  this will stiffen the dough, so it will not
flatten when baked into puffs or profiteroles.  
     when ready to bake, preheat oven to a hot 475 degrees f. 
using a couple of teaspoons, scoop small (large walnut sized)
mounds of dough on a greased cookie sheet.  place cookie sheet in
the hot oven for 10 minutes.  then reduce the heat to 325 degrees
f. and continue baking for an additional 25 - 30 minutes, or till
puffs are a medium brown color.  the puffs must remain in the
oven for the full baking time, or they will collapse soon after
being taken from the oven.  
     after cooling, the tops may be removed with a sharp knife,
any remaining uncooked dough may be removed from the inside, and
the puffs may be filled with any appetizer filling or desert
filling desired.
     this recipe makes approximately 18 puffs.

     

                profiteroles a la reine
          puffs with tarragon-flavored chicken

2 tbs. butter                  1/4 tsp. grated nutmeg
2 tbs. flour                   cayenne pepper, pinch
1/2 c. chicken broth           2 tsp. chopped fresh tarragon, or 
1/2 c. heavy cream                    1 tsp. dried.
salt, if desired               1 1/2 c. leftover chicken, cut into cubes
black pepper, to taste         24 cream puffs
 
     melt the butter in a medium saucepan, add the flour, stirring with a 
wire whisk.  when blended, add the broth, stirring rapidly with the whisk.
when it is thickened, stir in the cream, and stir til blended.  add the
salt, pepper, nutmeg, cayenne and tarragon.  let simmer, stirring, for
about 2 minutes.  stir in the chicken and bring to a boil. remove from
the stove. this should have a very thick consistency.  if it is not thick
enough, it may be further thickened by the addition of a small amount of flour
dissolved in water or broth, and stirred into the mixture while being heated, 
until it thickens.
    slice off the tops of the cream puffs.  spoon an equal amount of the 
chicken mixture into each puff.  replace the tops and serve.  these may be 
made up an hour or two in advance, and reheated before serving in a 
slow (325 degree) oven, or for a few seconds in a microwave.  do not
make them up too far in advance, since the puff casings will tend to
get soggy.



             profiteroles aux crevettes a l'indienne
                puffs with curried shrimp filling

3/4 lb.  fresh shrimp,           3 tbs. finely chopped chutney
         shelled and deveined           salt, if desired
1 tbs. butter                           freshly ground black pepper,
3 tbs. finely chopped onion                to taste
1 tbs. curry powder, or less,    24 cream puffs
       to taste. 

     chop the shrimp into 1/2 in. or smaller pieces.  there should be about 
1 1/4 cups.  set aside.  melt the butter in a medium saucepan and add the 
onion. cook, stirring until the onion is golden.  add the curry powder and 
stir to blend.  add the cream and chutney and cook down until there is
only about 1/2 cup left.  add the salt, pepper and shrimp, and cook, stirring,
for 1 or 2 minutes, or until the shrimp loses its raw look.
     slice off the tops from all the cream puffs.  spoon an equal portion
of the shrimp mixture into each cream puff.  replace the tops and serve.



Chicken Ravioli in Port Mustard Creme Sauce with Mango Ginger Chutney

serves 4 as a pasta dish before the main meal.

Pasta

	1 cup flour
	1 egg
	1 tbl water
	1 tbl olive oil (gives gummy texture)

	prepare two sheets of pasta rolled out to "6" on the Atlas machine.
	You can knead by hand forever or use a food processor on the dough.

Egg wash

	1 egg
	2 tbl water

	whisk together and brush on one side of each piece of pasta. The
	egg wash acts as a glue to hold the ravioli together during
	cooking.

Filling

	6 oz. cooked chicken (Chef Johnson called for smoked)
	1/6 cup cream
	1/4 cup mango ginger chutney (buy from your grocery store!)

	Combine in food processor, or chop chicken finely with knife and
	mix together. (Chef Johnson called for some cayenne and more
	chutney, but I cut it down to my taste because I thought it was
	too spicy.)

Prepare ravioli by putting 1-1 1/2 tsp lumps of chicken filling on
one piece of pasta in a 2xN matrix where N is ~10-12. Place other piece of
pasta over this. Egg side of both sheets should be toward the inside. Cut
ravioli with a knife or a ravioli wheel. Seal ravioli with fingers or
by pressing with a fork. Flour well and set aside.

You should make 20-24 ravioli. You will need 16 to serve. Expect a few
to fall apart while cooking.

When sauce is ready, cook ravioli until they rise.

Sauce

	1 cup port wine
	8 peppercorns, bruised or cracked
	1 bay leaf
	2 shallots, diced

	Reduce over high heat until nearly dry.

	1 cup chicken stock

	Add and reduce until total volume is about 1/4 cup.

	1 cup cream
	1 tbl mustard

	Add, whisk, and reduce until sauce naps. (Napping means: dip a
	spoon in the sauce, wipe the back horizontally with your finger.
	If the sauce does not run it is thick enough.)

	Strain the sauce and keep warm. (Strained sauces come from
	French tradition. You want a smooth pretty sauce with no chunks
	of pepper and lumps of shallots.)

	I adjusted the proportions in this recipe from Chef Johnson's
	original. I used less cream and more port because I like the
	greater flavor and color from the port.

Prepare four individual plates. On each plate, pour an equal portion of
the sauce. Makes sure the sauce coats the entire center of the plate but
none of the side. Place four cooked ravioli on the place, and scoop
about 2 tbl of the chutney on the middle of the plate. It should look very
pretty.

What sort of wine would go with this course? I've had it with a
Chardonnay and with a German Riesling. In both cases, the ginger, etc.,
overpowered the wine. Perhaps an Alsatian Gewurztraminer would do
better, or perhaps this course just isn't suited to wine. :-(


Baba Ghanoush / Eggplant with Tahini


3 large eggplants
2-4 cloves garlic, or to taste
Salt
1/2 c tahini or less, depending on size of eggplants
juice of 3 lemons, or more to taste
1/2 t ground cumin (optional)
2 T finely chopped parsley
A few black olives or 1 tomato, thinly sliced, to garnish

Cook the eggplants over charcoal or under a gas or electric 
broiler (sear until skins are black and start to blister with
the flesh soft and juicy, rub skins off under cold water taking
care to remove any charred particles, then gently squeeze out as
much of the bitter juice as possible).  

Crush the garlic cloves with salt.  Mash the eggplants with a
potato masher or fork, then add the crushed garlic and a little
more salt, and pound to a smooth, creamy puree.  Alternatively,
use an electric blender to make the puree.

Add the tahini and lemon juice alternatively, beating well or
blending for a few seconds between each addition.  Taste and add
more salt, lemon juice, garlic, or tahini if you think it is
necessary, and if you like, a little cumin.

Pour the cream into a bowl or a few smaller serving dishes.
Garnish with finely chopped parsley and black olives, or with
a few tomato slices.  Serve as an appetizer with Arab or other
bread, as a salad, or as a party dip.

PHYLLO CHEESE PASTRIES

1 lb muenster cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 TB chopped parsley
1 lb frozen phyllo dough
2 sticks melted butter

Grate the muenster cheese finely in a food processor or with a hand grater.
Add eggs and parsley and blend well.

Remove the phyllo dough from the freezer
and gently unroll.  With a sharp knife, slice dough into thirds,
lengthwise, so that each is approximately 4" x 12".  Re-wrap two thirds of
the dough in plastic and return to the freezer.

Tear a large piece of wax paper and place on counter.  Working quickly,
take one sheet of phyllo dough and brush liberally with butter.  Top with
two more sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter.  Place approximately
1 TB of cheese mixture at one end of the buttered sheets, 1 inch from the
edge.  With your fingers, roll the dough over the cheese mixture twice.
Fold in the edges of the dough and continue rolling tightly until the end.
(Be careful not to tear the dough or roll too loosely, otherwise the cheese
will spill out when baking).
Place
seam side down on a cookie sheet and brush tops with butter.  Repeat with
remaining phyllo sheets.  Bake at 400 degrees for approximately 15 minutes
or until golden and crispy.

MUSHROOM-BACON PATE - PARTY PATE WITHOUT LIVER


     2 lbs     fresh mushrooms, chopped very fine
     1/2 lb    bacon (or more, to taste)
     2/3 cup   onion, chopped very fine
     2/3 cup   celery, chopped very fine
     8 oz      cream cheese, at room temperature
     4         eggs
     1/2 cup   parsley, chopped very fine
     2 cups    dry bread crumbs
     1 tsp     salt
     1 tsp     dried rosemary
     1 tsp     dried oregano
     1/4 tsp   ground black pepper

          (1)  Fry the bacon and crumble it as fine as possible.
               Reserve some of the grease.

          (2)  Chop the mushrooms, onion, celery, and parsley as
               fine as possible.  A food processor works best,
               but you can do it by hand if need be.

          (3)  Saute the onion and celery in the bacon grease
               until soft, then remove from the grease, and
               drain.

          (4)  Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese slightly, and
               then beat in the eggs.  Add all other ingredients
               to the eggs/cheese mixture. Mix thoroughly.

          (5)  Grease a large loaf pan or two small, line with
               foil, and then grease the foil.  Pat the mixture
               into the loaf pan and cover loosely with foil.
               Bake for 1 1/2 hours at 400 deg. F.

          (6)  Let cool completely before serving.

NOTES
     This pate is actually best when refrigerated before serving.
     Serve with crackers, or with bread cut into shapes with
     cookie cutters.

     To make this a more elegant buffet dish, garnish the top
     with a thin layer of aspic.

     

Lumpias 

1 10 Oz Can Water Chestnuts Drained and Minced
2 Eggs
1 Tsp Black Pepper
1 Bunch Green Onions, Minced
2 Yellow Chili Peppers, Minced
1/2 Tsp Salt
1 Tsp Minced Garlic
1Lb Ground Pork
1 Package Mu Shu Pork Wrappers
An egg and 1 Tbl Flour Mixed together in a small bowl
Chili Sauce

Combine the first eight ingredients and mix thoroughly. With a wrapper
on a plate in front of you, put about 1 tbl meat on a corner as though
you were going to wrap the meat up in a piece of butcher paper. Using
your fingers, pinch the meat into a cylinder. Bring the lower corner up
over the meat, wrap the sides in, and roll the meat up around the rest
of the wrapper. Secure the edge of the wrapper by using the egg mixture
as glue. Deep fry the lumpias until crispy and golden brown. Serve at
once with chili sauce.


Roasted Garlic

1 head of garlic
Butter and fresh thyme (optional)

Using a sharp knife, cut the pointed top off the garlic
head so that the cloves are just visible through the
cuts in the top of the garlic.  Several hours before serving,
put the garlic in the oven at 250 degrees for 20-25 minutes.
Remove and let cool.

Just before serving, put the garlic on a heatproof serving
dish; garnish with butter and crossed sprigs of fresh thyme,
if desired.  Heat oven to 450 degrees and roast garlic for
5-10 minutes, or until brown all across the top.  Serve while
still warm.

To serve: We use cocktail forks (gotta have some use for the
silly things) to scoop out the cloves of garlic from the head.
Then you mash them on warm French bread.  The appetizer last
night included a wedge of herb Brie next to the head of garlic,
and the combination was very nice.

Basic Sourdough Starter (from Sourdough Cookery)

First: see if you can get some from your friend instead!  If not:
2 c. flour
1 tsp salt
3 tbl sugar
1 tbl yeast (1/2 pkg)
2 c. lukewarm water

Never let sourdough starter touch metal.  Use a wooden spoon and plastic,
ceramic or wooden bowl.

With a wooden spoon stir dry ingredients together and gradually add warm
water.  Stir until mixture resembles a smooth paste.  Cover with towel and set
in a warm place to sour.  Stir mixture several times a day.  In 2-3 days the
sourdough will be ready.

Store in a plastic container, with holes punched in the lid to allow gases to
escape.  I use a yogurt or margarine container with holes in the lid.

To make batter for a recipe, take out 1 cup stater and add 1 cup flour and 1
cup lukewarm water.  (I usually just use all of the starter and add 1 cup or
more of flour and water).  Stir with a wooden spoon.  Don't worry about the
lumps.  Cover and set in a warm location overnight (or at least for a few
hours).  Before you use the starter be sure to save at least 1/2 cup (add it
to any saved starter).  As soon as the lumps are gone it's ok to use the
batter.  If you leave it overnight it may seperate before morning, just stir
it back together.

Once a week replenish the starter this way.  I typically just put all of the
starter into a bowl and add 1/2 - 1 1/2 cup of flour and water. If I don't
intend to make bread I use just 1/2 cup, if I need alot of starter I use up to
1 1/2 cups.  The starter stays more "sour" if you leave it on the counter for
several days at a time and if you try not to add too much flour at any one
time.  However I have never gotten a truely sour sourdough out of this
starter (well, see additional notes below).

If the starter starts acting somewhat whimpy, add 1 tbl of yeast when you
replenish it.  Be sure to occassionally completely clean the container that
you use for storing the starter!

I find that the starter occassionally puts off a bit of grey liquid on the top
of the container.  I usually pour this off.  As the starter matures the amount
of grey liquid decreases.

There are other starters in this book, including one made from yogurt.  I'm
slightly reluctant to keep a yogurt starter going forever, but a friend claims
he had one he really liked.  I may try that as I prefer a good sour bread.

.
Sourdough Bread, regular: (Based on recipe in _Sourdough Cookery_ pg 35)

2 - 2 1/2 c refreshed starter
.(refresh the starter using about 2 cups flour and 2 cups water, 
.use 2 cups for this recipe and put the rest back in the refrigerator)
1 cup milk (if you want sour bread, use yogurt; but that still doesn't make it
.*real* sour)
3 tbl butter or margarine
2 tsp salt
1 pkg (2 3/4 tsp, 1 scant tbl) yeast
.proofed in 1/4 cup warm water and 2 tbl sugar
6 1/2 cup flour (approx)
1 tsp baking soda

Remember: Never let sourdough starter touch metal.  Use a wooden spoon and
plastic, ceramic or wooden bowl. I use a plastic bowl and wooden spoon for the
entire process.

Heat milk or yogurt until scalded.  Remove from heat.  Add butter or margarine
(so it melts).  Let cool.

When cooled to lukewarm, combine milk/yogurt with the starter and the yeast.
Put 2 cups of flour and the baking soda and salt in a sifter (which mixes it
together nicely) and sift into starter.  Mix until fairly smooth.  The mixture
should be about as thick as a brownie batter.  If it's too thin add a bit more
flour.

Cover and let rise for 30-40 minutes until doubled.  

Using a heavy wooden spoon (get a real strong one from JPMeads! for <$3!) mix
in the remaining flour about 1 cup at a time.  When it's too hard to mix,
knead it with your hands in the bowl until it stops being very sticky.

Turn the dough onto a floured board and knead it, continueing to incorporate
flour as needed.  Knead 5 minutes or more until smooth and elastic.  The dough
will be extremely smooth and silky.

Let dough rise for 1-2 hours until doubled.  Punch down.  Seperate into 2
loaves (or 2 1/2 loaves).  Shape into loaves or shape into round loaves and
place in greased 8-9" pie pans.

Let rise until about 1 1/2 times original size.  Bake at 375 degrees for 50
minutes or until done.  Yum.

Variation: Add 1 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese and 1 cup diced pepperoni or
ham to the first slurry mixture.  A real favorite!

Variation: 7/6/92: I accidentally learned how to make sourdough bread that's
very sour.  I mixed up some bread adding flour until it was the consistency of
brownie dough.  As always, I left the bread to rise.  Well, things got hectic
and I left the bread at this stage for about 12 hours.  Then I put it in the
fridge overnight.  The next morning I let it warm up, finished making and
kneading the dough and baked it as usual.  Basically the dough sat for at
least 24 hours and the sourdough starter dispersed throughout the batter!

The result was a loaf of sourdough bread that is very *sour*!  Like the "San
Fransisco sourdough" we used to find in Seattle.  Love it!!!


.
Sourdough Oatmeal Bread (Based on recipe in _Sourdough Cookery_ page 44)

1 1/2 cups refreshed starter
2 cup oatmeal 
1 1/2 cup yogurt (or milk)
1/2 cup molasses 
1/4 cup brown sugar
.(I substitute 1/2 cup honey for both molasses and brown sugar)
3 tbl margarine (melted or at least softened)
1 package yeast (1 scant tbl) proofed in 1/4 cup warm water and 2 tbl sugar
1 tsp baking soda
2 tsp salt
3 - 4 1/2 cup flour

Heat the yogurt until almost boiling.  Pour it over the oatmeal and stir and
let stand a while so the oatmeal softens.  Add margarine and
sugar/molasses/honey.  When cooled to lukewarm add the yeast mixture and the
sourdough starter.

Sift 1 cup flour and baking soda and salt and add.  Mix with a wooden spoon
until smooth.  Cover and let rise.

Add the rest of the flour mixing it in.  When it's too stiff to mix, continue
mixing in the bowl with your hands.  When it's no longer sticky, turn onto a
floured board and knead, adding flour as needed.

Let the dough rise.  Punch down, divide into two loaves, shape and place in
greased loaf pans.  Let the dough rise again.  Bake at 400 degrees for 35-40
minutes.


Variations: 

Add 1 cup shredded mozerella, montaray jack or munster cheese to the oatmeal
mixture.  This bread will last *forever*.  We took it in the car on a road
trip for 5 days and on the 5th day it was as fresh as on the first day.
Furthermore the consistency of this bread is very good; it can be sliced very
thinly without crumbling.

Substitute 2 cups whole wheat flour for the oatmeal.  Add 1 cup shredded
cheese.


.
Tomato-Cheese Sourdough Bread (Based on recipe in _Sourdough Cookery_ page 50)

Really MARVELOUS bread!  Quickly disappears at parties.

Yield: two *large* round loaves

1 cup refreshed starter
1 28 oz can Italian plum tomatoes
1/2 can tomato paste
2 pkgs (2 tbl) yeast proofed in 1/4 cup water and 2 tbl sugar
3/4 - 1 lb extra sharp cheddar cheese, grated
1/2 tsp baking powder
2-3 tbl margarine or butter, melted
2 tsp salt
6 cups flour

Remove tomatoes from their juice and dice them into small pieces.  Add diced
tomatoes, about half of the juice from the canned tomatoes, tomato paste and
cheese to the starter mixture.  Add the melted margarine.  Mix.  Add the
yeast.

Sift baking powder and salt with 2 cups of flour.  Add to the starter mixture.
You should have a slurry the consistancy of brownie batter (add another cup of
flour if need be).

Let the slurry rise until doubled in bulk.  Add the rest of the flour 1 cup at
a time.  When the mixture is too stiff to stir, continue adding flour while
kneading it in the bowl.  Turn out onto a floured board and knead (while
adding flour as neede).  The dough should be very smooth and silky.

The dough rise until doubled.  It rises fairly quickly.  Punch down and divide
into 2 or 2 1/2 loaves.  Form into loaves and place in greased loaf pans or
greased 8-9" pie pans.  I use 2 pie pans and a small half-loaf pan; the round
loaves are huge!  Let rise.  Bake at 375 degrees for about 40 minutes.

Variation: add some refreshed dried tomatoes.  You might want to cut down on
the tomato paste and tomato juice with this variation.

Superb Margherita Pizza (Based on recipe in _Sourdough Cookery_ page 212) 
2 very large pizzas (actually almost enough dough for 3 pizzas)

1 1/2 cups replenished sourdough starter
1 cup scalded milk
1 1/2 tsp salt
2 tbl butter or margarine
1 tbl yeast proofed in 1/4 cup water and 2 tbl sugar)
3-4 cup flour

olive oil
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves
handful fresh oregano leaves (optional)
3 cloves garlic, peeled and diced
oil
1 large can Italian plum tomatoes, diced (or 1 1/2 cans preferred)
Mozzerella cheese
1/8 - 1/4 cup parmesan cheese 

Put margarine in milk so it melts.  Add salt.  Let milk mixture cool.  When
cooled add to yeast.  Add 1 cup flour.  If you have time, let this slurry
rise.  If you don't, add the rest of the flour.  Knead the dough, it will be
fairly soft and silky.  Let rise.  Divide into two (or 3?) and line a greased
pizza pan or 16"x13" pan.

Heat some oil in a saucepan.  Add the garlic and fry until brown.  Add the
diced tomatoes.  Reserve the juice in case you decide you want it later.  Stir
the tomatoes and cook them lightly until you get a nice tomatoe sauce.  It
won't be too thick and it will be quite chunky.

Spread a very thin layer of olive oil over the pizza crust.  Place the basil
and oregano leaves on the pizza.  Pour tomato sauce on top of the fresh herbs.
Cover with shredded mozerella cheese.  Put a small amount of parmesan cheese
on top.  Be sure to let the pizza rise for about 30 minutes or it will come
out real flat and cardboardy. Then bake at 425 degrees for about 25 minutes.

This is WONDERFUL pizza and it keeps much longer than most comercial pizzas
(it's still good almost a week later!).  Reheat in the oven instead of the
nuke if possible of course.  Very very very tasty.

Variations: 

- you can top a pizza with pesto and refreshed dried tomatoes.  I'ld probably
add a bit of cheese, but you don't have to.  That's the yuppie variation.

- Top with slices of fresh tomatoes before baking

- Substitute (lightly cooked) spinach for the basil, add mushrooms, top with 
sliced fresh tomatoes.

Carl Gohs' Bread (from Beard on Bread, page 37)

The first time I made this I thought it was wonderful.  Later attempts did not
seem quite as moist nor did they rise as high.  I think you should not use
more than about 3/4 cup of WW flour.  This bread is alot of work, but very
tasty.

3 pkgs (3 tbl) yeast refreshed in 1/2 cup water and 1 tbl brown sugar (or 2 tbl
.white sugar)
4 1/4 cups flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 med potato, unpeeled, boiled in 2 cups water
1 cup wheat germ
1/2 cup dried milk
2 tsp salt

Proof the yeast until it gets a 2" head.  Add 1/2 cup flour and stir until
it's a smooth paste.  Set this sponge aside to rise for about an hour.  Each
time it doubles in bulk, stir it down.

Boil potato until it is done.  Place it in a potato ricer.  SAVE the water!
Push the potato through the ricer until you have a very smooth mashed potato.
Measure 1 1/2 cups potato water (add tap water if you have to).  Add the
mashed potato to the water and set aside to cool.


Combine whole wheat flour, 1 cup regular flour, wheat germ, dried milk and
salt.  Stir well.  When potato mixture has cooled and yeast mixture has been
deflated at least two times, add both to the flour mixture.  Stir until all
ingredients are well blended.  Add up to another 1 cup of flour until mixture
is a slurry the consistency of brownie mixture.  Cover and set aside to rise.

Add the rest of the flour and knead the bread.  Let rise about 1-2 hours until
doubled in bulk.  Divide in two and form into loaves.  Place in greased loaf
pans and let rise again.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Immediately reduce
heat to 400 degrees when you put the bread into the oven.  Bake for 40
minutes.

Cracked Wheat Bread (from Beard on Bread, pg 71)

This is a MARVELOUS bread that I really like

1/2 cup of mixture of bulgher wheat and pearl barley (I use about 2/3 wheat and
.1/3 barley)
3/4 cup boiling water
1 package yeast (1 tbl) proofed in 1/2 cup water and 2 tbl sugar
1/4 cup margarine or butter
2 tsp salt
2 tbl molasses
2 tbl honey
1 cup milk
1 cup whole wheat flour
4 cups white flour

Pour the boiling water over the cracked wheat + barley, cover tightly and let
stand for 30 minutes until cooked.

Scald the milk and add the butter, salt, molasses and honey.  Cool to lukewarm
then add to yeast mixture.  Add the whole wheat flour and up to 1 cup of the
white flour.  When the mixture is about as stiff as brownie dough cover it and
let it rise.

Add the rest of the flour, knead and let rise.  Divide into two loaves, put
into greased pans and let rise.  Bake at 375 degrees for 30-35 minutes.

This is one of my favorite recipes and it always seems to come out
wonderfully!!!

.
Oatmeal Bread (from Beard on Bread pg 90)

This bread is somewhat heavy and dense but is very good toasted with cheese on
top.  One of my other cookbooks has an oatmeal and swiss cheese recipe and
that sounds like an interesting variation.  

1 cup oatmeal
1 cup boiling water
2 pkg yeast (2 tbl) proofed in 1/2 cup warm water and 1 tbl sugar
1 cup scalded milk
3 tbl margarine or butter
1 tbl salt
1/4 cup brown sugar (or honey)
4-5 cups flour

Cook the oats in the water until thickened, about 3 minutes.  Add the warm
milk, salt, brown sugar or honey and margarine.  Mix together. Let cool. 

When cooled add the yeast.  Add about 1-2 cups of flour until mixture has
consistency of brownie batter.  Let rise.  Add the rest of the flour.  Knead, 
adding flour as needed. 

Let rise.  Punch down and divide into two.  Form into loaves and place in
greased loaf pans.  Let rise.  Bake 45-50 minutes at 375 degrees.  CAUTION: my
notes say to check them after 35-40 minutes!

Whole Wheat Rollup Loaves, 2 loaves, 
.roughly based on Cinnamon Swirl Loaf in The Complete Book of Breads

A very soft WW bread that has various treats rolled up in it.  When I made it
I found that the bread tended to seperate and get huge holes between the
filling and the bread.  I don't know how to solve this problem.  The idea came
from a spinach and feta rollup that Kim got at Ludgates.

Place.2 cup white flour
.1 tsp salt
in mixing bowl

Heat.1 1/4 cup milk (or yogurt)
Add .1/4 cup margarine

Proof 1 1/2 package yeast (1 1/2 tbl) in 1/4 cup warm water and 1 tbl sugar

Add 1/4 cup honey to milk and margarine mixture.  Let cool until lukewarm.

When cooled, add milk and yeast mixtures to the dry ingredients.  Mix with a
mixer on medium for 2 minutes.

Add .2 eggs
.3/4 cup wheat germ (and/or oat bran, etc)
.3/4 cup whole wheat flour
.1/4 cup shredded fresh herb such as basil (optional)

Mix 3 minutes more.  Should be a medium thick dough

Let rise

Add .1 1/2 - 2 1/2 cup flour (4 1/2 - 5 1/2 cup flour TOTAL)
.
Knead.  Let rise.  Divide into two.  Roll each half out flat.  Spread with
filling.  Roll up.  Pinch *TIGHTLY* shut.  Let rise.  I do not know how to
prevent the dough from seperating from the filling.

Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.  Test with a toothpick.

Possible fillings: 
.shredded cheese and diced ham
.shredded chesse and pieces of spinach

It may be helpful to spread the dough with a thin layer of butter or
room-temperature cream cheese or ricotta before adding the filling.  When I
spread the dough with cream cheese, the dough did NOT seperate from the cream
cheese.  This implies you might have to spread the cream cheese on both sides
of the dough before rolling it up?

Idea: Try twisting the bread after you make a loaf and before you put it
in the pan.  Twist it 1-2 times.  This won't prevent the holes, but it will
make it so the holes swirl through the loaf instead of cutting the loaf into
multiple pieces horizontally.

Despite the holes, this is a very good bread.  Very soft and light.  Almost
like a soft dinner roll.

Herb Bread (based on Potato Bread in The Complete Book of Bread)

Proof 1 package of yeast in 1/4 cup warm water and 1-2 tbl sugar

Boil 3 small potatoes in 2 cups water and rice them (see Carl Goh's bread
above).  Result:
.1 1/2 cup potato water
.3/4 cup boiled, riced potato

Combine potato, potato water with
.1/2 cup butter
.1 tsp salt
.1 tbl sugar
.1/2 cup dried milk
When cooled, add the yeast mixture.

Add 2 - 2 1/2 cup flour to make a slurry the consistency of brownie batter.
(Or use 1 cup flour and 1 cup wheat germ).  Stir to remove most of the lumps.
Let rise for an hour or more.  

Add 4-6 cups flour and knead.  The dough is very soft and smooth!  Let rise
for an hour or more.  Knead for a few more minutes and divide into three
pieces.

Roll each piece out flat.  Sprinkle with some fresh herbs (one herb per loaf),
such as:
.1 tbl diced fresh basil
.2 tsp diced fresh rosemary
.2 tsp diced fresh oregano
.fresh dill
.savory
.marjaram
.thyme

Fold up each piece and knead it to distribute the herbs.  Make each piece into
a loaf (or put in a 8-9" pie pan) and let rise.  Bake at 375 degrees.

Wheat and Oat Bread (Based on recipe in _Complete Book of Bread_)

This is a MARVELOUS Bread!!! It's extremely tasty and very good warm from the
oven.  It's also good lightly toasted or even completely toasted.  It's sweet,
you could cut back the honey, but it's GOOD!

2 packages yeast proofed in 1/2 cup warm water and 1 tbl sugar
1 cup oatmeal
2 tsp salt
2 tbl margarine or butter
1 cup raisens 
  (or substitute dried apples or other dried fruit for some of the raisens)
1 cup bran (I used wheat bran)
2 3/4 cup boiling water
3/4 cup molasses (I used half molasses and half honey!)
1 cup whole wheat flour
6 cups white flour

Proof the yeast.

Combine oatmeal, salt, margarine, raisens and bran.  Pour the boiling water
over this.  Stir and set aside to cool.  This may take a half hour or more.
Add the molasses/honey.  Test the mixture with your wrist.  When lukewarm add
the yeast mixture.  Stir in the WW flour and 1-2 cups of white flour.  When
the dough has the consistency of brownie batter, cover it and let it sit aside
to rise until doubled in bulk.

Add the rest of the flour.  When too stiff to mix, continue to add flour while
kneading it within the bowl.  When dough is no longer sticky, turn onto a
floured board and knead while adding flour.

This dough is a very rich, moist, firm dough.  It has a very warm and rich
feeling, and a sweet wholesome smell.  Be sure to knead it thoroughly. 

Let dough rise.  Punch down and knead for a few more minutes.  Divide into two
(or 2 1/2) pieces.  Form loaves and place in greased loaf pans.  Let rise.
Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour (check it before then).  Remember that the loaf
is fairly dark in color so don't try to judge doneness just by color!

.
Cheddar Cheese Bread (based on recipe in _Complete Book of Bread_)

A very tasty bread, appropriate for any party.  The cheddar cheese flavor is
strong, so you should probably serve this with just butter or cream cheese;
the flavor may be too strong for sandwiches.  The consistency of the bread is
good, it crumbles a bit, but not too much.  Very very rich because of all the
cheese.

Yield: 2 loaves

2 cups water
2 tsp salt (or 1&1/2 tsp if you use salty margarine)
2-3 tbl butter or margarine
1/2 cup dried milk
12 oz === 3 cups grated extra sharp cheddar
.you can add some parmesan or another type of cheese if desired
1 package yeast proofed with 1/4 cup warm water and 1/4 cup or less sugar
6 cups bread flour

Heat the water until it boils.  If you have a microwave, heat it in a 4 cup
pyrex measuring cup.  When it's boiling, add the cheese, salt, butter, dried
milk.  Stir.  The cheese should start to melt right away.  Stir to encourage
the cheese to melt and to mix the ingredients together.

(Alternatively: add 2/3 of the cheese to the water and reserve the last cup of
cheese for adding with the flour.)

When cheese mixture has cooled, place in a large bowl.  Add a cup or two of
flour, which will cool it further.  Add the yeast mixture.  Add another cup of
flour.  When the mixture is the consistency of brownie dough, let it sit for
about 30-60 minutes so it rises.

Continue adding flour 1 cup at a time.  You may need more than the 6 cups
recommended.  Mix in the flour, then turn the dough onto a board and knead it.
Knead for 10 minutes or until it is the right consistency and no longer
sticky.

Let rise for up to an hour.  I find that this particular bread rises *very*
fast.

Form into two loaves.  You might prefer round loaves, but I usually make
rectangular loaves.  Let rise 30-60 minutes; again, it rises very quickly!

Bake at 375 degrees for 30 - 45 minutes.  The book specifies 45 minutes, but I
find this too long.  The bread browns very quickly.  Check it after 20 minutes
and if it is very brown, consider turning the oven down to 350 degrees.  Cook
until loaves are well browned and cooked through.  I find that this bread
cooks very quickly and is usually done in 35 minutes or so.

Rice Bread

In _English Bread and Yeast Cookery_, Elizabeth David says that she has come
across several recipes that add cooked rice to bread.  She feels that the rice
improves the keeping quality of the bread.  She suggests adding a maximum of
1/2 cup raw rice for each loaf of bread.  She also likes using brown rice.

I made the following recipe with brown rice.  The bread was fairly dense and
full of rice kernel munchies (like crunchies, but no crunch!).  It was very
good bread when lightly toasted or warmed and topped with melted cheese.

This recipe combines David's suggestion with the standard homemade bread
recipe in Beard's book.

3/4 cup brown rice
1/4 cup barley
1 1/2 cup water
Cook the brown rice and barley in the water until done.  This will take about
45 minutes.  Set aside to cool.  Note: you can also use cooked white rice.  I
usually cook 1 cup of rinsed white rice in 1 3/4 cup water.

1 package of yeast
2 tbl sugar
1/4 cup warm water
Proof the yeast in the water and sugar.  Optionally add about 1/4 cup after the
first rising and let the yeast proof again.

2 cup scalded milk
1/4 cup melted butter (it will melt in the hot milk) (or slightly more)
2 tsp salt
1/2 cup wheat germ
Combine.  Add the rice mixture.  Set aside and let cool.  If you stir it it
will cool slightly faster.

When the milk/rice mixture has cooled to a baby's milk temperature, add the
yeast mixture.  Add 1-2 cups of flour to make a sponge the consistency of
brownie batter.  Let the sponge rise.

Add another 2-4 cups of flour.  Knead the bread thoroughly.  Shape into 2 or 2
1/2 loaves and let the loaves rise.  The bread doesn't seem to rise much in
the oven so let the loaves rise as high as you want them.  Bake at 400 degrees
for 40-45 minutes.

Dilly Casserole Bread (from Complete Book of Bread)

According to one cookbook, the original dill (or double dill) bread was a
prize winning recipe in the 19XX (1920?) World's Fair and since then there
have been many variations.  The key ingredients are cottage cheese and dill
seeds or weed. 

I haven't actually made this bread but I keep meaning to.  I think there's a
recipe in every cookbook, this one is from CBoB.

1 pkg yeast
1/4 cup water
1 cup cottage cheese at room temperature
2 tbl sugar
1 tbl instant onion bits
2 tsp dill seeds (or dill weed (or both?!))
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking soda
1 egg
2 1/4 - 2 1/2 cup flour
Glaze: 1/2 tsp melted butter to brush top and sprinkle of salt

Grease a 1 1/2 qt casserole dish (approx 7" diameter, 4" deep).  I'm sure a 
loaf pan will also work!

Proof yeast.

In a saucepan heat cottage cheese until warm to the touch.  Pour cottage
cheese into bowl with yeast and add sugar, onion bits, dill seeds (or weed),
salt, baking soda and egg.  Add flour, a half cup at a time, to make a stiff
batter.  BEat will after each addition.

Cover and let rise.  Stir down and turn into casserole dish.  Cover and let rise again.  NOTE: Beard on Bread DOES knead this bread!!!

Cover and let rise again.  Bake at 350 degrees until deep brown and crusty.
Check with a toothpick. Cover with foil or brown paper for the last 15 minutes
to prevent excesive browning.

Remove bread from oven.  Immediately brush with butter and sprinkle lightly
with salt.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes before removing it from the casserole
dish.

Subject: Garlic Potato Bread
Date: Mon, 25 Nov 91 22:46:38 EST

>From A World of Breads by Dolores Casella

This is a highly unusual but delicious bread.  It's best served at barbecues,
or with a hearty meal.  I always serve it with barbecued spareribs.

.1 large potatoe, boiled, cooled, and grated (1 1/2 cups grated potato)
.1 large clove garlic put through a garlic press
.1 teaspoon salt
.1 cup warm potato water
.1 cake yeast
.2 teaspoons sugar
.2 cups flour
.softened butter

Combine the potato, garlic (use more garlic if desired), salt, potato 
water, yeast, and sugar.  Stir until the yeast is dissolved and then add the
flour.  You will have to finish mixing this dough with your hands.  When it
is thoroughly blended, brush the top of the dough with soft butter, cover,
and let rise until doubled.  Punch the dough down and turn it into a well-
buttered 8 or 9-inch skillet.  Brush the top of the dough with soft butter
again and let rise again.  Bake in a 425 degree oven until well browned and
done, approximately 25 to 30 minutes.

Wheat-Berry Bread

1/2 cup wheat berries
1 cup boiling water
1 cup cold water
2 cups warm water (110-115 degrees F)
2 tbl dry yeast (2 pkgs)
1/4 cup honey
1 tbl salt
1/4 cup oil
(1 cup oats optional)
8 cups whole wheat flour
2-4 cups unbleached white flour

Place the wheat berries with the boiling water in a saucepan and simmer until
the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.  Add the cold water and trasfer the
mixture to a large bowl.  Add the warm water and check the temperature (it
should be lukewarm).  Add the yeast and all of the other ingredients except
the white flour.

Mix the dough thoroughly with a wooden spoon, then add half of th ewhite flour
and befin to knead.  Keep adding flour until the dough is easy to handle and
will keep its shape.  Knead for 7-8 minutes.

Put the dough in a greased bowl and turn it greased side up.  Cover it and put
it in a warm place to rise until it has doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Punch down the dough, knead it briefly to break up any large bubbles and cut
it in half.  Make two round loaves and put them on a baking sheet that has
been sprinkled with corn meal.  (Alternatively use 3 greased loaf pans.)  Use
a sharp knife to cut a cross in the center of each loaf.

Put the pan in a cold oven and turn on the heat to 350 degrees (or use a
preheated oven).  Bake for about 1 hour or until the bread is brown and sounds
hollow when tapped on the bottom.

For an extra-crisp crust, brush the loaves with cold water several times
during baking.

Cool on racks.

Challeh, 3 loaves

4 cups hot water (or substitute 1 cup of yogurt or milk)
1/2 tsp tumeric (or saffron if you're feeling rich)
2 tbl yeast
2 tbl salt
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup wheatgerm (optional)
1/2-1 cup dried milk powder
2-4 eggs beaten (extra yolks or whites are welcome)
1/2 cup oil
About 8-10 cups unbleached white flour, enough to make a soft, unsticky dough

Dissolve the tumeric or saffron in the hot water along with the yeast and
salt.  Add the rest of the ingredients in order, working in as much flour as
possible while the dough is still in the bowl (this saves a lot of counter
cleanup afterwards).  Oil the counter, turn out the dough and knead it for 5-8
minutes until it feels smooth and springy and the surface blisters.

Form the dough int a ball, place it in an oiled bowl or pot, oil the top of th
edough lightly and cover it with a cloth or plastic wrap.  When the dough has
doubled in bulk, punch it down, turn it out on the counter an divide it into
thirds (each of these will eventually be one loaf of bread or pan of rolls).
You can bake Challeh in a traditional rectangular bread pan if desired.

Now the fun begins.  Take one of these pieces of dough and divide it into four
even parts.  Roll three of them into ropes about the length of your bread
pans.

Braid these ropes together in this way: attach the ropes at one end by
pinching them firmly together; cross the rope on the right over the rope in
the center; cross the rope on the left over the rope in the center; repeat
until you run our of rope and then pinch the ends together.

You now have completed the big braid for the bottom of the challeh and will
now make the thin braid as follows: divide the fourth part of the dough, which
has been waiting patiently for you to get around to it, into three parts and
braid these just as you did the big braid.  Place this thin braid on top of
the big one, right down the middle lengthwise, so the braids are going in the
same direction.  Pinch the ends to secure the braids together and place in a
well-oiled bread pan.  Brush the top well with an egg yolk beaten with a tsp
or two of water (which is sufficient to glaze all three loaves of challeh) and
then sprinkle generously with either sesame or poppy seeds.

This method of braiding (which my grandmother would have called cheating since
it doesn't braid together eight ropes) is easy once you get the knack, which
you can develop by practicing with string.  It produces breads that are high
and beautiful to look at witht he texture characteristic of challeh.  Don't
ask me why, but a braided loaf of challeh tastes different than a regularly
shapped one.

With the other two sections of dough waiting to be formed, you can either
repeat the above process, in which case you will have three challehs (they
freeze very well), or you can do a number of variations.  The simplest and one
of the best is to knead about a cup of raisens into one of the sections and
then braid it as above, paint it with eggyolk and sprinkle it with seeds.
This is a classic raisin challeh and guarenteed to disappear very quickly.

When you have prepared all your loaves, let them rise until light and high,
place them in the oven, set it at 350 degrees and bake them for about an hour.
Take the baked loaves from the oven, let them sit for about 10 minutes and
then remove them from their pans to let them cool on racks (the oven racks are
fine so long as you leave the oven door open)

Whole Wheat Bread

The following recipe is basically from _The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book_.
This book contains about 200 recipes that all use *only* whole wheat flour.
None of the recipes use white flour.  At first I believed this would make a
brick; but I found that it makes a bread that's very chewy and, while not
particularly light, very good.

I believe the key is to knead the dough *alot*.  tLKBB claims that if you make 
two loaves you'll have to knead the bread twice as long!

This recipe is based on the main recipe in tLKBB, but it includes some
modifications that I used.

1/4 cup - 6 tbl warm water
1 pkg yeast (tLKBB says 1 tsp)
2 tsp sugar
3 cups whole wheat flour, finely ground
1 tsp salt 
1 cup milk, scaled and cooled
.(or 1/3 cup cold yogurt mixed with 2/3 cup hot tap water per tLKBB)
2 tbl oil
1 & 1/2 tbl honey


Use hot tap water to warm up a small bowl.  Place the warm water and sugar in
the warmed bowl and mix them.  Slowly pour the yeast over the water making
sure to get all of the yeast mixed in.  Set it aside to proof.

Scald the milk and add the honey.  Let the mixture cool until lukewarm.

Place about 2 & 1/2 cups of flour in a bowl and mix in the salt.  I sifted the
flour.  Make a well in the center.  Pour in the milk and yeast mixtures.
Start mixing the dry and wet ingredients; start by stiring the mixture in the
center and gradually widen the spiral and incorporate the flour in the bowl.
Slowly add the last 1/2 cup of flour until you get a stiff dough that and you
can't add any more flour.  You should use most of the flour.

You may wish to knead the dough still in the bowl a bit to get the kneading
started.  I often do this to get the dough well mixed together.

tLKBB suggests using water instead of flour while kneading the dough.  I did
this and it worked well.  The kneading changes the dough from a sticky mess to
a firm dough that's barely sticky.  You can use either flour or water to keep
the dough from sticking to the counter.

Place a small bowl of warm water next to your kneading board or counter.  Wet
your hand and rub it over your kneading board until there's a light film of
water on the surface.  Also rub water over your hands until they are slightly
wet.

Place the dough on the counter.  In one hand hold a metal spatula that you
will use to collect the dough while it's still very sticky.  With your free
hand, press out the dough in the typically kneading manner.  With the spatula,
scrape the dough up from the counter and recreate one pile of dough.  This is
a slightly strange method of kneading, but you'll get the hang of it very
quickly.  Once the dough starts to get firm you won't need the spatula and
you'll be able to knead with both hands.

tLKBB states that you should knead a single loaf of bread for 300 kneading
strokes.  If you are making two loaves you will need (knead) 600 strokes.  I
found that I used about 350 strokes.  About every 50 strokes put a bit more
water on your kneading board and your hands (and take a brief rest).  When
kneading by hand it's almost impossible to overknead and you really want this
dough well kneaded or it will be heavy.

Per tLKBB, "When the dough is fully developed, it will pull into a paperthin
sheet, smooth and bright.  When you hold it to the light, you can see the
webbing of the gluten strands in the sheet".  In particular you should be able
to stretch a fairly small piece into a sheet that's about 4" in diameter and
is so thin that it resembles paper or fabric.  You should be able to do this
with only an occassional tear; if you have trouble doing this or the dough
keeps tearing knead it some more!  You will see flecks of the whole wheat bran
in between white sections of dough.  Apparently if your wheat is ground
extremely fine you will see a dough with a beige color and may not see many
flakes of bran.

Remember, it's almost impossible to overknead the dough if you are working it
by hand.  Knead it until you are sure it's fully kneaded!

tLKBB says that you should not grease the bowl that you use for rising the
dough.  Wash your original bowl and place the dough into it.  Cover it and set
it someplace out of drafts to rise.  tLKBB suggests placing it on a towl that
is over a heating pad.  Let the bread rise until about double in bulk.

Punch the dough down and let it rest for about 10 minutes.  Then shape it into
one loaf of bread.  Let it rise a second time until it is spongy.  When you
press it with your fingers the indentation should fill slowly.  If the bread
rises too much at this step (e.g. if the dent from touching it doesn't fill
slowly) it won't rise again in the oven (aka "oven spring").  If the loaf has
risen over the top of your pan you can slash it down the top to allow it to
rise even more in the oven.

Bake at 350 degrees for one hour.  If the bread if fairly brown after 30
minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.

tLKBB describes each of these steps in incredible detail.  If you're really
interested in whole wheat breads read a copy of the first chapters of this
book.

The following recipe is from a company cookbook put out by the
Stone-Buhr Milling Company of Seattle, Wash., called 'Cooking With
Gourmet Grains'.

SWISS OATMEAL BREAD        The Swiss cheese gives this bread a unique
                           taste. It's good toasted or in toasted cheese
...   sandwiches!

 1 1/2  cups milk                     1/2  cup  warm water
   1/4  cup  firmly packed brown        2  pkgs active dry or cake yeast
             sugar                      2  cups uncooked regular rolled oats
     2  tsp  salt                       1  cup  grated Swiss cheese
     3  Tbs  butter or margarine        4  cups unsifted all-purpose flour

    Scald milk.  Stir in brown sugar, salt and margarine.  Cool to lukewarm.
Measure warm water into large warm bowl. Sprinkle or crumble in yeast, stir
until dissolved. Stir in lukewarm milk mixture, rolled oats, Swiss cheese, and
half the flour. Beat until thoroughly blended. Stir in enough flour to make a
soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth and
elastic, about 10 minutes. Note that you will not be able to stretch the dough
too thin because of the oatmeal, but you can stretch it fairly thin with a
minimum of breaking.  Do not underknead!

Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover, let rise in warm place
free from drafts, until double in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn
out onto lightly floured board.  Divide dough in half and shape into loaves.
Place into two greased 9 x 5 loaf pans. Cover, let rise in warm place, free
from draft, until double in bulk, about 1 hour.  Bake at 375 deg. F. about 35
minutes or until done.  (Or maybe a slightly lower temperature).  Remove from
pans and cool on wire rack.

      Title: Almond Nougat
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  2
 
  1 1/2 c  Light corn syrup
      2 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Water
      2    Egg whites
    1/2 ts Almond extract
           Red or green food coloring
    1/4 c  Soft butter or margarine
      1 c  Toasted chopped almonds
    1/4 c  Chopped candied cherries
 
  DIRECTIONS: Mix first 4 ingredients in heavy saucepan. Cook, stirring,
  until sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, until a small amount of
  the mixture dropped in cold water forms a hard ball (250-F). Beat egg
  whites until stiff, but not dry, in large bowl of electric mixer. Gradually
  beat in about one fourth (not more) of the syrup, and continue beating
  until mixture holds its shape. Cook remaining syrup until a small amount of
  mixture separates into hard and brittle threads when dropped in cold water
  (300-F). Gradually beat into first mixture, and continue beating until the
  mixture begins to hold its shape. Add flavoring and food coloring to tint a
  delicate shade. Beat in butter; continue beating until very thick and
  satiny. Stir in nuts and cherries. Press into a buttered 8x8x2" pan,
  smoothing top. Let stand until firm. Turn out of pan, and cut in 1 1/2" by
  1" pieces. Wrap each piece individually in waxed paper. For best flavor,
  store several days in a cool place before serving.

    3/4 c  Brown sugar (packed)
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine (butter
           -makes it richer)
    1/2 pk (6 oz size) semisweet
           -chocolate chips. (1/2 cup)
 
  Almond Rocca: This is not for Almond Roca, yet it is close enough and it is
  real easy. In fact my 14 year old daughter has been making it by herself at
  christmas for the past 4 years. Hope this will meet your needs. It comes
  from the Betty Crocker cookbook, so you may have it on hand already.
  
  Toffee: Butter square pan, 9x9x2 inches. Spread chopped nuts in pan. Heat
  sugar and butter to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil over medium heat,
  stirring constantly, 7 minutes (watch it real close the last minute or
  two).  Immediately spread mixture evenly over nuts in pan. Sprinkle
  chocolate pieces over hot mixture; place a baking sheet over pan so
  contained heat will melt chocolate.  Spread melted chocolate over canndy.
  While hot, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares.  chill until firm.
  
  Now for the changes we use.
  
  When we are going to be giving this as a gift, we melt another 1/2 cup of
  chocolate in the microwave.  Use an 7x7x2 pan (or smaller than the 9x9x2).
  Spread the melted chocolate on top of the buttered pan that is covered with
  the nuts.  After the chocolate is spread on top, sprinkle more nuts on top,
  while chocolate is still warm. Then cut into small sizes. After the candy
  is set, remove from the pan and wrap individually with desert foil. I get
  mine at the bakery supply, or a craft shop.

 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  1
 
  2 1/2 lb Dry Candy Fondant
      1 c  Butter

    1/2 c  Whipping cream
 
  Mix first 2 ingred. & let set overnight <or for several hours> tightly
  covered. Add cream & whip with heavy duty mixer or by hand. Divide dough
  into separate bowls. <I divide into 3>. Makes nice batch of each. For each
  bowl, add whatever color/flavor, etc you like. Below are some ideas:
  Vanilla cremes: add vanilla ****to taste. Chocolate cremes: add melted dark
  chocolate to taste. Mint center: add drops of peppermint oil & pink
  coloring. Black Walnut center: add drops black walnut oil & bl walnuts.
  Peanutbutter cremes: add smooth or crunchy peanut butter. Pineapple cremes:
  add drops pineapple oil, chopped candied pineapple & chopped pecans. Jelly:
  add fruit "flavored" jelly into candy mold with matching flavored oil
  w/creme center. Nut center: wrap creme center mix around a nut meat as
  filling; dip in white/tinted, or milk chocolate. Chocolate covered cherries
  <cream type:> wrap creme center  mix around a well-drained marachino
  cherry...be sure the cherry is SEALED in the dough, chill & dip in choc.*
  Be sure to dip as soon as removing from fridge. The acid in the cherry
  causes it to start cordialing <liquifying> quickly. Will liquify some, but
  some will remain "creamy" because of the butter. Coconut cremes: add
  maccaroon coconut & drops or coconut oil For any dipped cremes: Form 1"
  balls, let crust over & dip in compound coating chocolate. This is also
  called "dipping chocolate." I prefer the brand "Merckens." It seems to take
  more abuse/ reheating, or getting too hot, etc. Dolores McCann, Hamilton

      2 c  White Sugar, Granulated
    1/2 c  Light Corn Syrup
    1/2 c  Water
      1 pn Salt
      2 lg Egg Whites
      1 ts Vanilla Extract
      1 c  Nuts, Chopped *
 
  * Chopped cherries or chopped orange peels may be used in place of chopped
  nuts.
  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE:  To prewarm a candy thermometer, simply place it in a sauce pan of
  cold water and bring it to a boil.  Let it simmer until you need the
  thermometer. STEP 1: Prewarm the thermometer; separate the eggs allowing
  the whites to come to room temperature in a large bowl of an electric
  mixer.  (Return the egg yolks to the refrigerator covering with plastic
  wrap or water for another recipe.) Fill a glass with ice cubes and water.
  To make dropped divinities, you will need 2 cookie sheets, topped with
  greased wax paper. For squares, use a greased and wax paper-lined 8 X
  8-inch pan.  Measure the sugar, corn syrup, ice water and salt and dump
  into a heavy 2-quart saucepan with a tight fitting lid. STEP 2: Dissolve
  the sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon over low heat. Syrup
  will become clear, gritty sounds will cease, and the spoon will glide
  smoothly over the bottom of the pan. Increase the heat to medium and bring
  to a boil. STEP 3: (OPTIONAL): Cover pan with a square of wax paper and
  lid, pushing down firmly. Steam for 2 to 3 minutes to dissolve the sugar
  crystals.  (Listen to make sure the pot doesn't boil over.  To double
  check, remove lid, leaving the wax paper in place.) STEP 4:  Wash down any
  crystals clinging to the sides with a brush dipped in hot water from the
  thermometer bath.  Introduce the prewarmed thermometer.  No need to stir.
  STEP 5:  Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry.  If your mixer is a
  heavy duty one, you can wait until the bubbles in the syrup become very
  large and airy before beating the egg whites.  Otherwise, do it now when
  the thermometer registers 240øF.  STEP 6:  Test the syrup when the
  thermometer registers 246øF.  Continue testing until it reaches the
  firm-ball stage, 246ø to 260øF.  Syrup will be hard to scrape up in ice
  water.  It will have to be forced into a ball, but once formed, it should
  hold its shape but give under pressure.  Return the thermometer to the hot
  water bath to soak clean. STEP 7:  Dribble the syrup into the egg whites in
  a slow, steady stream, beating at slow speed.  Tilt the syrup pan to get
  the last drop but do not scrape the pan.  Once the syrup is completely
  incorporated, change to a flat whip if you have one. STEP 8:  Have patience
  and continue beating.  The amount of time you spend mixing depends on the
  power of your mixer.  If you have a heavy duty or commercial one, you can
  go to full speed and make the divinity in less than 5 minutes. With less
  powerful ones, it can take up to 20 minutes. The important thing is to beat
  at the highest speed of your mixer.  Also if it is a hot and humid day, it
  will take longer also. STEP 9:  Test the divinity. The first and most
  important test occurs when you lift the beaters. If the candy falls back in
  ribbons that immediately merge back into the batter, it isn't done.
  Eventually, a stationary column will form between the beaters and the bowl.
  Candy will lose its sheen/gloss and stop being sticky; a teaspoonful
  dropped onto wax paper will hold its shape, even a peak. If you machine is
  laboring and the candy is not quite there yet, you have two choices: Pour
  anyway and put into a frost free freezer to set up....or finish by hand.
  STEP 10:  Fold in the flavorings and nuts and/or other optional items using
  the mixer or if very thick, a wooden spoon. STEP 11: Drop or spread the
  divinity either on wax paper covered cookie sheets or the buttered pan.
  Dripping it by teaspoon is harder work for you but it ripens quicker and is
  ready to eat sooner.  A neat trick is to put the candy into a pastry bag
  and pipe onto the wax paper. If you spread it in the pan, you will have to
  wait up to 24 hours before it is ready. But you maybe one of those that
  think it is better when it is 24 hours old. Score and cut into squares.
  Store in an airtight container at room temperature or in a refrigerator.
  Makes 1 pound but looks like more. Recipe CANNOT be doubled; it can be
  frozen but not for extended periods of time.

           -seeds, I think)
 
  "Benne seeds cannot be procured in many places, but the candy made with it
  is so delicious and so characteristic of Charleston that the recipe is here
  included."
  
  Add the extracts to the sugar.  Melt the sugar in a saucepan, stirring
  constantly, as for peanut brittle.  When the sugar is melted, add the benne
  seed, stirring it in quickly.  Pour at once onto a marble slab to cool or
  pour into lightly buttered pans.  Mark in one-inch squares while still warm
  and break along the lines when cold.  --Mrs. Rhett

      Title: Brown Sugar Fudge - Penuche
 Categories: Candies, Christmas
   Servings:  6
 
      1 c  White Sugar, Granulated
      1 c  Light Brown Sugar, Firm Pack
    1/2 c  Heavy (Whipping) Cream
      3 tb Molasses *
      2 oz Unsweetened Chocolate
      4 tb Butter
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Chopped Nuts, Optional
 
  * This is to taste.  The original recipe called for 4 T of Molasses.
  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  STEP 1:  PREPARE:  Prewarm the thermometer in hot water; use a 2-quart
  saucepan; butter the upper sides (inside) of the saucepan; measure all
  ingredients except the vanilla and optionals, and dump into the saucepan.
  Grease and if necessary, line a 5 X 10-inch pan.  Fill glass with ice cubes
  and water and the sink with 1/2 inch of cold water. STEP 2: Dissolve the
  sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, over low heat until the
  butter melts, the gritty sounds cease, and the spoon glides smoothly over
  the bottom of the pan.  Increase the heat to medium and bring to a boil.
  STEP 3:  Boil, after washing down any crystals that may have formed, with a
  pastry brush dipped in hot water from the thermometer bath, using as little
  water as possible.  Introduce the prewarmed thermometer.  Reduce the heat
  while keeping the fudge at a boil.  Stir no more than necessary. STEP 4:
  Test the fudge mixture in the ice-cold water when the mixture thickens and
  bubbles become noisy.  Ball, formed in ice water, should hold its shape
  until the heat from your had begins to flatten it and should be al dente --
  slightly chewy -- between 230øF and 240øF.  Because of the molasses and
  brown sugar, it can ball at a lower temperature than some other fudges.
  STEP 5:  Shock by placing the saucepan in the cold water in the sink. STEP
  6:  Seed by adding, without stirring, the vanilla.  Then allow to cool.
  STEP 7:  Stir when luke warm and "skin" forms on the top (110øF). Return
  the thermometer to its hot water bath to soak clean. Stir the fudge
  thoroughly but not vigorously by hand, with an electric mixer, or with a
  food processor.  Pause frequently to allow the fudge to react. STEP 8:
  Watch for the fudge to thicken, lose its sheen, and become lighter in color
  or streaked with lighter shade, give off some heat, suddenly stiffen. If
  mixing by had, the fudge will "snap" with each stroke; by mixer, mixer
  waves will become very distinct, by food processor, fudge will flow
  sluggishly back to the center when the processor is stopped. STEP 9: Add
  the optionals (1/2 Cup Chopped Nuts (walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts,
  filberts)) before the fudge totally candies. STEP 10: Pour, score, and
  store when cool in an airtight container in the refrigerator or at room
  temperature. YIELD: 1 pound of fudge. Recipe is easily doubled and can be
  frozen. VARIATIONS: HONEY BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1, eleminate the
  unsweetened chocolate and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup of honey. The
  honey causes the fudge to ball at a higher temperature. CHOCOLATE HONEY
  BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, replace the heavy cream with light cream or
  evaporated milk and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup of honey. ORANGE
  BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, eleminate molasses, chocolate but add 1 Tbl
  corn syrup.  In Step 6, add 1 T grated orange zest, plus if you can get it,
  1 tsp of pure orange extract. PEANUT BUTTER BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1,
  eliminate the molasses and chocolate, replace the heavy cream with 1/4 cup
  of milk and 1/4 cup of creamy peanut butter. To intensify the peanut butter
  flavor, add 1/3 of a cup of salted peanuts in Step 9. PRALINE BROWN SUGAR
  FUDGE:  In Step 1, eliminating the molasses is optional -- you'ss get a
  more Southern praline with it, a milder one without it--or compromise and
  use only 1 T.  Eliminate the chocolate. In Step 3, when the mixture begins
  to thicken, add 1-1/2 cups of pecan halves slowly so as not to break the
  boil or cool the mixture too quickly.

           - preferably organic
  2 1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Water
      2 tb Corn syrup
           Superfine sugar; for coating
      5 oz Semisweet chocolate
      1 tb Butter
 
  SCORE GRAPEFRUIT INTO QUARTERS and carefully pull off peels or juice fruits
  and cut halves again in half. Place peels in large pan, cover them with
  cold water and bring to boil. Simmer 25 minutes. Remove peels and let them
  cool until they are easy to handle. Hold peels firmly against counter and
  gently scrape away most of white pith just below skin. Cut cleaned peels
  into strips with knife or scissors as narrow or wide as you like. In
  2-quart saucepan, mix together sugar, water and corn syrup. Bring to boil.
  When syrup is clear, add peels, lower heat and cook slowly until peels are
  translucent, about 1 hour. Set cake rack over baking sheet. Remove peels a
  few at a time and spread them out on rack to drain about 15 minutes. While
  they are draining, thickly cover large plate with super- fine sugar. Set
  several pieces at a time in sugar and turn them to coat them. When evenly
  coated, set them aside on another plate or piece of parchment paper thinly
  coated with sugar. This process will need to be done in several batches. If
  sugar become lumpy with beads of syrup, pass it through a strainer, then
  continue using it. Set aside sugared peels about 1 hour or until they are
  dried. Carefully package them in tin or plastic container and store either
  in cupboard or refrigerator. To dip peels in chocolate, melt semisweet
  chocolate over simmering water along with butter. Stir well to ensure that
  mixture is smooth before removing from heat. Dip each rind into chocolate,
  coating most of it but leaving a little "handle" to grasp. Or, completely
  immerse each rind in chocolate, then remove with 2 forks or pair of
  chopsticks. Set slices on parchment paper or cake rack and place in cool
  place to harden. Once chocolate has set, pieces can be stored in
  refrigerator. Chocolate will discolor when it cools but will become dark
  and glossy again once brought to room temperature.

  With spoon, remove white inner portion of peel. With knife or tiny star
  cookie cutter, cut a few stars from peel, if desired. With scissors or
  sharp knife, cut rest of peel in thin strips. Make syrup by boiling 2 cups
  sugar with 1 cup water. Add a little red or green food coloring. (A drop or
  two of yellow coloring with red improves the finished color.) Add peel;
  cook over low heat until peel has a clear, candied appearance. Remove peel,
  2 or 3 pieces at a time, allowing excess syrup to drain back into saucepan.
  Roll strips separately into remaining 1 cup sugar until well coated. Place

                          Stages of Syrup Cooking Slightly more cooking is
  required on damp or rainy days than on a dry , clear day. Allowance is made
  for this in the following table. The higher temperature should be used on a
  damp day while the lower is right for clear weather. Soft ball, for
  fondant, fudge, panocha_______________ 234F. to 238F. Firm ball, for
  caramels______________________________ 246F. to 248F. Hard ball, for
  taffy_________________________________ 265F. to 270F. Crack stage, for
  butterscotch________________________ 290F. to 300F. Hard crack, for
  brittles, sticks, lollypops__________ 300F. to 310F. Hard crack stage, for
  clear hard candies_____________       to 310F.
                            Cold Water Test
      Pour about 1/2 teaspoon os the hot candy into a cup nearly full of very
  cold water. Shape the syrup with the fingers of one hand. Soft ball: The
  syrup can be formed into a soft ball which flatens on removal from the
  water. Firm ball: The syrup can be formed into a ball which offers some
  resistance to the fingers. Hard ball: The ball which is formed is
  distinctly chewy. Crack: The mixture sounds britle when struck against the
  side of the cup; it can be broken by crushing between the fingers. Hard
  crack: The brittle mixture will not stick to the teeth.
      If a thermometer is used, it should be tested in boiling water. It
  should register 212 F. If 214 F., cook candy 2 degrees higher, if 210 F.,
  cook candy 2 degrees lower. Make your adjustments accordingly.
 
 
      Title: Candy Melt Roses
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  6
 
     14 oz Candy Melts - (1 package)
    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
 
  Melt candy melts according to package directions.  Add heated light corn
  syrup and stir until thoroughly mixed.  Let set at room temperature in an
  airtight plastic bag for at least 24 hours or up to one week. Candy becomes
  easier to work with as it sets.  When ready to use, knead a small amount
  until it reaches a workable consistency.
  
  MODELING A ROSE: Start with the base and mold a cone that's approximately
  1-1/2 inch high from a 3/4-inch diameter ball of modeling candy. Next, make
  petals.  Flatten 3/8-inch ball of modeling candy into a circle that's about
  1/4-inch thick on one side and about the diameter of a dime. Make several
  petals this size. Wrap first petal around the point of the cone to form a
  bud.  Now press three more petals around the base of the bud. Gently pinch
  edges of petals.  Make five more petals using slightly larger balls of
  modeling candy.  Flatten, then thin edge with finger and cup petals. Press
  petals under first row of petals. Continue adding petals, placing them in
  between and slightly lower than previous row. For a fuller flower, continue
  adding petals in this manner.
  
  TO MAKE CANDY LEAVES: On the back of clean, thoroughly dried, grape or rose
  leaves, paint on melted Candy Melts with a soft pastry or decorator's
  brush. Pull out pointed or curved edges to resemble certain kinds of
  leaves. Let coating set and when completely dry, carefully peel off candy.

   Servings:  1
 
      3 c  Milk
     13 oz Powdered sugar
           Eggsize piece of glucose
  3 1/4 oz Chocolate in tablets
  1 1/2 oz Butter
    1/2    Vanilla bean
 
  Put milk, sugar, vanilla bean and glucose into a stewpan. Put the chocolate
  into a round-bottomed copper pan and melt it slowly on the stove.
  Meanwhile, heat the mixture in the stewpan, not letting it boil, since you
  merely want to melt the sugar and glucose. When completely melted, pour
  this mixture, bit by bit, into the chocolate, while stirring. When
  thoroughly mixed, cook at moderate heat, constantly stirring. Cook to the
  'ball' stage. (To test the stage of cooking by finger, dip the thumb and
  index finger into cold water, then into the mixture, bringing the 2 fingers
  together and dipping them again into water. This should be done quickly to
  avoid burning. The mixture forms a ball that can be rolled with the tip of
  the fingers.) Remove from the fire, add the butter, mix well, and pour onto
  an oiled marble slab in an oiled, iron framework. Let cool and cut.

  since it is the primary ingredient. Valhrona is my first choice and
  Callebaut is my second.
  
  BRING THE CREAM TO A BOIL and pour it over the cut chocolate. Allow to
  stand 1-to-2 minutes and stir smooth. Beat in the softened butter and cool
  to set. Beat with an electric mixer (using a paddle attachment if
  available) on medium speed until light. Beat in Cognac. Pipe out small
  truffles on parchment or waxed paper with a pastry bag fitted with a
  1/2-inch plain tube. Refrigerate to set. Melt the chocolate. Sift the cocoa
  into a deep pan. Dip the truffles in the melted chocolate and then deposit
  them in the cocoa, shaking the pan to cover them. After the covering sets,
  shake the truffles in a strainer to remove the excess cocoa.

      Title: Chocolate Balls with Cherry Centers
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  6
 
     50    Whole candied cherries
    3/4 c  Cherry brandy (more may be
           -necessary)
    1/2 lb Sweet milk chocolate, broken
           -into pieces
    1/4 lb Unsweetened baking
           -chocolate, broken into
           -pieces
  1 1/3 c  Powdered sugar
    7/8 c  Butter, softened
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa
           Powdered sugar
           Unsweetened cocoa
 
  Soak the cherries in the brandy overnight or longer.  Drain the cherries,
  reserve the brandy.
  
  Cream the butter and sugar in a mixer.  In a double boiler, melt the
  chocolates.  Spoon the melted chocolate, spoon by spoon, into the butter
  and sugar mixture and mix thoroughly by hand.
  
  Add reserved brandy to sugar and chocolate mixture and stir by hand until
  all is absorbed.  Add 3 T. cocoa and mix by hand.
  
  Put mixture in the freezer and thoroughly chill.  Prepare a surface to
  assemble the balls.  Mix equal amounts of cocoa and powdered sugar, about
  1/3 cup each.  On a piece of waxed paper, heavily dust with the cocoa
  powdered sugar mixture.  Remove the chocolate from the freezer when it is
  chilled and stiff.  For each cherry, spoon out a heaping teaspoon of the
  chocolate and drop on dusted paper. Dip your fingers into the cocoa/sugar
  mixture and flatten chocolate to a small pancake. Place a cherry in the
  center and fold chocolate around it.  Gently roll the ball between your
  palms to form and finish by rolling the ball in the cocoa/sugar mixture.
  Repeat for each cherry.  If the chocolate mixture softens, return to the
  freezer to firm up.
  
  Place the completed balls in a container with a lid and store in the frig.
  
  These balls are dense and heavy with a rich chocolate flavor.  For a
  lighter flavor, I suggest you omit the unsweetened baking chocolate and add
  1/4 lb. more milk chocolate.
  
  Licking your fingers is not permitted during the assembly, but manditory
  after you are done.  (grin)
 
      Title: Chocolate Covered Candied Cherries
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  6
 
     50    Whole candied cherries
    3/4 c  Cherry brandy
    1/2 lb Sweet milk chocolate, broken
           -into pieces
    1/4 lb Unsweetened baking
           -chocolate, broken into
           -pieces
  1 1/3 c  Powdered sugar
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa
           Powdered sugar
           Unsweetened cocoa
 
  Soak the cherries in the brandy overnight or longer.  Drain cherries,
  reserve the brandy.
  
  Cream butter and sugar with a mixer.  In a double boiler, melt the
  chocolates. Spoon the melted chocolate, spoon by spoon, into the butter and
  sugar mixture and mix thoroughly by hand.
  
  Add reserved brandy to sugar and chocolate mixture and stir in my hand
  until all is absorbed.  Add 3 T. cocoa and mix by hand.
  
  Put mixture in a clean bowl and thoroughly chill in the freezer. Meanwhile,
  make a 50-50 mixture of powdered sugar and cocoa.  Begin with 1/3 c. EACH
  and mix thoroughly.  Heavily dust a sheet of waxed paper on a working
  surface.
  
  When the chocolate mixture is chilled and very stiff, remove from the
  freezer. Drop by teaspoonfuls on dusted working surface and dust your
  fingers in the sugar/cocoa mixture, press with fingers to make a small flat
  shape with the chocolate.  Drop a cherry in the center and form a ball
  around the cherry.
  
  Working quickly, complete the shape by rolling the ball between your palms.
  
  Roll ball in sugar/cocoa mixture to coat.  Continue working until the
  chocolate mixture is too soft to continue.  Return to freezer to chill some
  more and continue until all the chocolate and cherries are gone.
  
  The chocolate covered cherries can be stored in the frig.
  
  For a lighter, sweeter chocolate taste, increase the sweet chocolate and
  decrease or eliminate the unsweetened chocolate.  The more milk chocolate
  you use, the more diffucult it will be to work with as it melts rather
  rapidly.
  
  You can also substitute and equal portion of semi-sweet bits (toll house
  chocolates) for the chocolate.
  
  Other candied fruit and liquors can be used according to your taste.
  
  Enjoy!

      Title: Chocolate Toffee
 Categories: Candies
   Servings: 64
 
      1 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  Light corn syrup
  1 1/2 c  Half-and-half
  1 1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
           - melted
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      1 pn Salt
 
  COMBINE THE SUGAR, CORN SYRUP, and 1/2 cup of cream in a large saucepan set
  over moderate heat. Stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves completely.
  Insert a candy thermometer, reduce the heat to low, and cook the syrup,
  stirring frequently, until the thermometer registers 238F. Blend in another
  1/2 cup of the cream, which will cause the temperature to drop, and
  continue to cook and stir until the thermometer reaches 236F or until a bit
  of the hot toffee dropped into a little cold water forms a soft, pliable
  ball. Mix in the remaining 1/2 cup cream and the melted chocolate. Cook the
  toffee, stirring constantly, lest it scorch. Cook toffee until the mixture
  becomes quite thick: A drop of it should firm up quickly in cold water.
  (NOTE: Even though the temperature of the toffee may not exceed 230F, if it
  firms in cold water, remove the pan from the heat at once.) Quickly mix in
  the vanilla and salt, then pour the toffee into a well-buttered
  8-by-8-by-2-inch pan. Cool the toffee completely, then cut it into 1-inch
  squares. Wrap each one in waxed paper or plastic wrap.

      Title: Chocolate Balls with Cherry Cordial Centers
 Categories: Candies, Martin
   Servings:  6
 
     50    Whole candied cherries
    3/4 c  Cherry brandy (more may be
           -necessary)
    1/2 lb Sweet milk chocolate, broken
           -into pieces
    1/4 lb Unsweetened baking
           -chocolate, broken into
           -pieces
  1 1/3 c  Powdered sugar
    7/8 c  Butter, softened
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa
    1/3 c  Powdered sugar
    1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa
 
  Soak the cherries in the brandy overnight or longer.  Drain the cherries,
  reserve the brandy.
  
  Cream the butter and sugar in a mixer.  In a double boiler, melt the
  chocolates.  Spoon the melted chocolate, spoon by spoon, into the butter
  and sugar mixture and mix thoroughly by hand.
  
  Add reserved brandy to sugar and chocolate mixture and stir by hand until
  all is absorbed. Add 3 T. cocoa and mix by hand.
  
  Put mixture in the freezer and thoroughly chill.  Prepare a surface to
  assemble the balls.  Mix equal amounts of cocoa and powdered sugar, about
  1/3 cup each. On a piece of waxed paper, heavily dust with the cocoa
  powdered sugar mixture. Remove the chocolate from the freezer when it is
  chilled and stiff. For each cherry, spoon out a heaping teaspoon of the
  chocolate and drop on dusted paper. Dip your fingers into the cocoa/sugar
  mixture and flatten chocolate to a small pancake. Place a cherry in the
  center and fold chocolate around it. Gently roll the ball between your
  palms to form and finish by rolling the ball in the cocoa/sugar mixture.
  Repeat for each cherry. If the chocolate mixture softens, return to the
  freezer to firm up.
  
  Place the completed balls in a container with a lid and store in the frig.
  
  These balls are dense and heavy with a rich chocolate flavor.  For a
  lighter flavor, I suggest you omit the unsweetened baking chocolate and add
  1/4 lb. more milk chocolate.
  
  Licking your fingers is not permitted during the assembly, but manditory
  after you are done.  (grin)
  
  There's yet another variation to chocolate covered cherries.  It's for the
  brave & daring at heart.
  
  You have to start in the summertime, when cherries are ripe.  You take a
  pound of them, a pound of rock candy, and a fifth of good brandy or
  bourbon. Mix together, & let set in the back of the 'fridge for 3-4 months.
  
  When you finally get around to making the chocolate covered cherries, you
  use the preserved cherries for the centers, & the liquor as the base for
  the cordial. Courtesy of: Al Martin

           -pieces
    1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
     26    Whole natural almonds (1-oz)
 
  Tastes just like Almond Joy.
  
  Line two large cookie sheets with waxed paper. Set large wire cooling rack
  on paper; set aside.
  
  Place coconut in large bowl; set aside.
  
  Place corn syrup in a 1-cup glass measure. Microwave on high (100%) 1
  minute or until syrup boils. Immediately pour over coconut. Work warm syrup
  into coconut using the back of a wooden spoon until coconut is thoroughly
  coated. This takes a little time, and yes, there is enough syrup.
  
  Using 1 level measuring tablespoon of coconut, shape into a ball by
  squeezing coconut firmly in palm of one hand, then rolling between both
  palms. (HINT: Measure out all of the coconut then roll into balls.) Place 2
  inches apart on wire racks. Let dry 10 minutes. Reroll coconut balls so
  there are no loose ends of coconut sticking up.
  
  Place milk chocolate and shortening in a 4-cup glass measure or 1 1/2 quart
  microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high 1 to 2 minutes or until mixture can
  be stirred smooth and is glossy; stirring once or twice.
  
  Working quickly, spoon 1 level measuring tablespoon of the chocolate over
  each coconut ball, making sure chocolate coats and letting excess chocolate
  drip down onto waxed paper. While chocolate coating is still soft, lightly
  press whole almond on top of each. Let stand to set or place in
  refrigerator. Store in a single layer in airtight container. Keeps best if
  refrigerated. Makes 26.

  thermometer reaches hard-ball stage(240F), or until a small drop of the
  syrup forms a soft ball in coldwater.  Set pan over boiling water.
  
  To build the pyramid, lightly dip the bottom oof a cream puff in syrup and
  set on the edge of the circle, syrup-side down.  Repeat with 9 more puffs,
  forminga ring. For the secong row,arrange a slightly smaller  ring of puffs
  overthe spaces between the puffs in the first row, inclinin g the second
  row slightly inward.  Fill in  the center with more puffs for support.
  
  Continue building the pyramid in decreasing rings, filling in cent er for
  support as needed, until you have completed 8 rows.

      Title: Easter Mints Kids Can Make
 Categories: Candies, Kids
   Servings:  1
 
    1/3 c  Soft butter
    1/3 c  Light corn syrup
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Flavoring
  3 1/2 c  ( 1 lb ) sifted
           -confectioner's sugar
           Large bowl
           Wooden spoon
           Paper plates
           Pencils
 
  This is a no-cook recipe the children can mix with their hands. Flavor it
  with any of the liquid flavorings in the supermarket, such as strawberry
  and lemon. If you want, you can instead divide it into three portions and
  add a few drops of food coloring to tint it yellow, red, and green. The
  knead a small amount of flavoring into each one. This recipe makes about 1
  1/2 lbs of candy.
  
  Help the children measure all the ingredients into the large bowl. They can
  take turns stirring it with the wooden spoon until it becomes too stiff.
  Then they can knead it with their hands. They should continue kneading
  until the dough is smooth.
  
  Give each child a paper plate and a pencil. Tell them to turn their plates
  OVER and write their names on the Bottom to prevent pencil lead from
  getting on their mints. Help them hold their pencils correctly. Make sure
  they use upper and lower case letters.
  
  Give each child a portion of dough on his or her plate. The children can
  pinch off pieces, roll them into balls, and press them lightly with a fork
  to make a fancy butter mint. Children who cannot roll the candy into balls
  can make snakes, cut the snakes into pieces, and press the pieces with a
  fork. They might eat the pieces with the fork, but that's ok too.
  
  Leave the mints on the plates and refrigerate them for 30 minutes, until
  they become firm. Easter Mints taste even better the second day, if you can
  keep everyone from eating them all on the first day. Cover with plastic
  wrap and keep them in the refrigerator.

      3 c  Sugar
  1 1/3 c  Water
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Light corn syrup
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  DIRECTIONS: Mix first 4 ingredients in large saucepan. Bring to boil,
  stirring. Cover, boil 3 minutes. Remove cover, and cook until a small
  amount of mixture forms a soft ball when dropped in cold water (238-F).
  Wash down sides of pan several times with a pastry brush dipped in cold
  water, using up and down motion. Pour out on ungreased platter. Cool to
  lukewarm (110-F). Add vanilla, and beat until mixture turns cloudy. Gather
  into a ball, and knead with lightly buttered hands until smooth and creamy.
  Put in bowl, cover with damp cloth, and store in cool place until needed.
  
  FONDANT DIPPED ALMONDS: Tint fondant with red and green food coloring. If
  desired, flavor green with wintergreen and red with peppermint. Melt each
  color in top part of double boiler over hot water. Dip rounded end of
  toasted almonds in candy; harden on waxed paper.
  
  FONDANT STUFFED DATES: Color fondant with red and green food coloring, as
  desired. Shape in small rolls, and fill pitted dates.
  
  BONBONS: Using 2/3 of fondant recipe for any one flavor of bonbon, work in
  desired flavoring and coloring a little at a time. Shape in 3/4" balls for
  centers. Bits of nuts, candied or dried fruits, or coconut can be added to
  these centers. Let stand on waxed paper, covered, overnight.
  
  Next day, melt remaining 1/3 of the fondant set aside for this batch in top
  part of metal double boiler over boiling water, adding flavoring and
  coloring to match fondant centers. Remove from heat. Set pan in cold water
  for a moment, and then put over hot (not boiling) water to keep fondant
  warm and soft. With dipping fork, or other fork, dip bonbon centers, one at
  a time, in melted fondant to cover. (Stir after each bonbon is dipped to
  keep crust from forming on top. If this fondant becomes too thick, reheat
  or add a few drops of hot water.) Tip bonbon over onto waxed paper covered
  tray. Decorative circles can be made by holding dipping fork on top of
  bonbon for a moment. Decorate at once with bits of nuts, candied fruits,
  silver shot or colored sugar, as desired. Leftover dipping fondant can be
  dropped on waxed paper to make patties. Store, covered, in cool, dry place.

      Title: Fruit Jellies
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  6
 
    1/2 pt Strained fresh raspberry
           -juice
      1 lb Loaf sugar
      1 oz Powdered gelatin
           Colouring if necessary
      2 tb Cold water
     10    Drops lemon juice
 
  Raspberry Jellies Prepare raspberry juice by crushing the fruit, warming it
  in a bowl over hot water until the juice flows freely and then straining
  through muslin. Soak the gelatine in the cold water. Dissolve the sugar in
  the juice and boil up to 240 F or the soft ball stage. Add the lemon juice
  and gelatine. Re-heat to 240 F and pour into a tin previously rinsed in
  cold water.  If the colour is pale add a few drops of cochineal before the
  end, but fresh fruit should give a brilliant colour. When set, loosen the
  sides with a hot knife and stand the pan on a cloth wrung out of boiling
  water.  Turn the jelly out on to a board.  Cut into cubes and roll in very
  fine confectioner's sugar.  Stand the sweets in a warm place overnight so
  that the sugar crystals adhers. Blackcurrant Jujubes 1/2 pint pure strained
  blackcurrant syrup 1 oz granulated sugar 1 tablespoon pure glycerine 6
  tablespoon glucose 1 oz powdered gelatine Soften the gelatine in a little
  water.  Dissolve the sugar and glucose in the juice - very slowly, over
  gentle heat.  Add glycerine and bring to boiling point. Remove from heat,
  add gelatine and stir until dissolved. Re-heat but do not boil. Rinse a 6"
  sandwich tin with cold water; pour the jelly mixture in. Proceed as in
  second paragraph of directions for Raspberry Jellies. This is a very good
  sweet for irritated throats. Fruit Jellies All juicy fruits in season make
  delicious sweets.  Proceed as for Raspberry Jellies, using colouring when
  necessary to enhance the natural tint. Redcurrants, gooseberries - both
  green and red - blackberries, hips and pineapples are just a few to be
  tried.  Fresh pineapple must be well cooked if used with gelatine, as it
  contains a natural digestant which dissolves gelatine. Two methods of
  Crystallising: CRYSTALLISING CANDIED FRUIT (This is the chapter that the
  author said to use for crystallising the jellies. I assume where it says
  fruit you would substitute jellies.) A sparkling finish is much sought
  after in this class of sugar work, so here are two recipes-one very simple,
  the other correct and of lasting quality. SIMPLE CRYSTALLISING Dip each
  fruit very quickly into boiling water-just in and out-drain it on
  blotting-paper or butter muslin.  Have ready sufficient sieved granulated
  sugar spread upon a sheet of paper to accommodate the fruits. Roll them
  gently about in the sugar until completely coated.  Leave in a dry, warm
  situation for some hours to reduce any moisture.  They will have a
  satisfying appearance, glistening in the light. ADVANCED CRYSTALLISING A
  crystallising tray is much to be desired for this purpose, but to
  improvise, a baking tray, deep and able to accommodate two wire cake racks
  on top of each other, will serve very well.  Carefully measure how much
  liquid will be required to cover the fruits when they rest in the tin.
  Place one rack in the baking tin, arrange the fruits upon it so that they
  do not touch each other or the side of the pan.  Place the second rack feet
  upwards upon the fruits, holding them gently in place. Cut a piece of
  greaseproof paper the exact size of the interior of your saucepan. Fold it
  across and across, then nip the centre point out leaving a hole about 1" in
  diameter. Make a syrup by dissolving 2 pounds of granulated sugar in 1 pint
  (20 ounces) of water. This is your basic recipe- increase it
  proportionately if the amount will not cover the fruits in the tin. They
  must be entirely immersed. Bring the syrup to a boil and strain it through
  muslin wrung out in hot water. Return the syrup to the saucepan, bringing
  it up rapidly to 220-225 F, remembering that the higher temperature gives
  larger crystals, and is good for imposing fruits, while 220 F gives finer
  crystals suitable for cherries, grapes and nuts. Put the pan where it won't
  be jarred in the slighest degree, covering the actural syrup with the
  prepared circle of paper. Steam will escape through the central hole.
  Agitation of the pan will result in a "grainy" syrup, so tread warily. When
  slightly cool-about 15 minutes-tilt the saucepan so that the syrup flows
  gently around and over the fruits held down by the wire cake rack. Cover
  with a cloth and leave for at least 12 hours. Then, if you have a
  crystallising tray, draw off the liquid.  Otherwise, gently lift your tray
  of fruits from the baking tin.  In eigher case place the fruits in a warm
  cupboard to thoroughly dry off once more. They should be covered with
  shimmering crystals of a size to suit your taste, according to the original
  temperature of the syrup. You will be left with a quantity of syrup which
  cannot be used again for crystallising. It can, however be used to make
  delicious toffee or to sweeten stewed fruits. Used with apples in lieu of
  sugar, it gives a unique flavour to an Apple Cake.

      Title: Fudge a la Louise
 Categories: Candies, Chocolate, Christmas
   Servings:  6
 
      4 c  Sugar
      3    Squares dark baking
           -chocolate
  1 1/3 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter, plus extra for
           -greasing platters
      1 c  Chopped nuts
  1 1/3 ts Vanilla
 
  In a heavy saucepan mix together the sugar, chocolate, and milk. Place the
  pan over high heat and stir constantly until the choclate is melted and the
  sugar is dissolved. Bring to a full boil, and lower the heat so the candy
  continues to boil gently, not vigorously. Stir no more. Put a candy
  thermometer into the center of the mixture and cook until the temperature
  reaches exactly 232 F. Meanwhile, butter a large platter (turkey size) and
  a flat pan about 11 by 13 inches. When the fudge reaches 232 F., pour it
  into the readied platter - do not scrape the pan, but let it drip out. Dot
  with 2 tablespoons butter and let the mixture cool until the platter feels
  cool underneath. Add vanilla. Take a large slotted spoon and start to stir
  the liquidy mixture - it will take about 15 or 20 minutes. You will see a
  steady change from dark to light color, from glossy to dull, from liquid to
  solid. When the fudge begins to get dull, add the nuts and mix in
  thoroughly. Put fudge into the large buttered pan and press into shape with
  the flat of your palms. Cut into squares; store in airtight container if
  there's any left.

  reduce cooking time 2 degrees. ***I use a TAYLOR thermometer. Wilton sells
  them now. Spray *PAM in molds & on surface. Not too much & only once per
  session. USE A THIN PAN, NOT HEAVY! Candy must set a few minutes in the pan
  & the temp will rise, burning the candy in a thick pan. Bring mixture to
  boil. Put lid on for 3 minutes <to wash down sugar crystals>, add
  thermometer & DON'T STIR. When therm. reaches 285-290D. remove pot from
  stove.Wait for temp. to lower below 260^ before adding color/flavor/citric
  acid. <Will cook flavor out if too hot.> Cover pan after adding citric acid
  so it won't fade the taste. I add about 2 ts citric acid.
        DON'T STIR!  Use the tiny viles of Lorann oils. Avail. in cake supply
  shop or drug store.
   I pour the cooked candy into a GUTTMAN candy funnel <holds entire recipe.>
  Thats the quickest way to get it in molds befor it cools & hardens. *Of
  course, spray funnel! I pour some into molds & the rest onto my marble
  slab. The part on the slab: I roll it into a long cylinder & cut into
  "pillows" w/scissors. Dust finished candies with powdered sugar so they
  won't "melt" together. There is one very nice sucker mold. It is a white
  ring w/ a slit for the stick. <Don't spray stick.> All you do is spray
  mold, add stick, fill w/candy, cool & remove easily Comes in 2-3 sizes,
  round or heart-shaped. I beleive it is Guttman Brand & available here at
  Sugarcraft. About 2 dz in a pack. This is my kids favorite Christmas candy.
  You will want to make several flavors. Experiment on how-much flavor. All
  vary. *Don't add too much on the mints. Takes more on the
  cherry/strawberry/lemon/orange, etc. There are at least 50 oil flavors
  available to choose from! Shared by Dolores McCann, Hamilton OH

      Title: Hints for Using a Candy Thermometer
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  1
 
MMMMM---------------------CANDY CLASS, SUGARCRAFT--------------------------
 
  ...Learn all the secrets of really GREAT candy making! *The first thing
  that should be done each day, before you start, is to TEST YOUR
  THERMOMETER! To do: immerse therm. in cold water. Bring to a boil.
     At sea level water boils at 212 degrees <on a sunny day.> If your water
  boils at 210 degrees, you should reduce the cooking time by 2 degrees. Most
  of the time, water boils here about 208 d. Try not to cook candies on a
  rainy day. The barometric pressure, when the air is heavy, holds the
  mercury in your thermometer down. "Make candy when the sun shines," motto
  of a good candy maker. *I recommend a TAYLOR or WILTON thermometer. Use a
  thin (good quality) pan for candies that MUST STAY IN THE PAN for any
  length of time for cooling. If you leave the thermometer in the pan, you
  may notice the temp. rising even after the candy is removed fro the stove.
  Using a heavy pan, your candy will burn, in this case. Use a HEAVY PAN for
  fudges, fondants, etc., that are to be dumped immediately. Dolores McCann,
  OH-- teacher.

      Title: Horehound Drops
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  1
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1 c  Fresh horehound leaves
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Corn syrup or honey
 
  Put the horehound in a small nonreactive sauce pan and add the water. Bring
  to a boil and simmer, covered, or 20 minutes.  Allow to cool, then remove
  horehound and squeeze out all the liquid.  Add the sugar and corn syrup or
  honey to the pan, stir with a wooden spoon while bringing to a boil, then
  turn heat down to a gentle simmer.  If bubbles threaten to overflow the
  pan, reduce heat slightly and stir.
  
  Boil to the hard-crack stage.  If you have a candy thermometer, this is in
  the range of 330 F, but even so you'll need to test often toward the end of
  cooking to get the hardness right.  Keep a shallow cup of cold water
  nearby.  Stir the liquid occasionally, and watch how it falls from the
  spoon.  When it forms a thread, begin testing for hardness by allowing a
  drop of the mixture to fall into the cup of cold water.  Don't trust your
  fingers to examine the now-hardened drop in the cup; bite it.  If it's at
  all gooey or sticks to your teeth, keep cooking.  When it's hard enough to
  crack when you bite it, remove the pan from heat immediately.
  
  If the mixture crystallizes, just add a cup of water and an extra
  tablespoon of corn syrup or honey to the pan, scrape all the crystalline
  chunks into it, and begin again.
  
  Lightly butter a candy mold, cookie sheet, or other heatproof baking pan,
  and pour in the hot mixture.  If you're using a flat-bottomed pan, score
  the surface of the candy after it has cooled enough to become firm.  This
  will help in breaking it apart, which should be done as soon as the candy
  can be handled.
  
  After individual "drops" are formed, sift granulated sugar or powdered
  sugar over them to keep them from sticking together.  Store in a
  moisture-proof container.

      1 lb Powdered sugar, unsifted
           -(about 3-1/4 cups)
     36    Walnut pieces
 
  Fudge gets texture from potato: potatoes cooked in the microwave oven give
  this fudge its unbelievably creamy, fudgey texture.  The mellow flavor
  comes from Irish Crem liqueur, used in both the fudge and the icing. Use a
  pastry bag to pipe the icing or a spoon to drizzle it onto the fudge. The
  added bonux is that this fudge is low in fat.
  
  Designer Icing (recipe follows)
  
  Line an 8x8x2-inch pan with foil. extending foil over the edges of the pan.
  Butter foil; set the pan aside.  Prick potato 2 or 3 times witha fork. Cook
  on 100% power (High) for 4-5 minute sor until tender, turning over once.
  Cool and peel.  Mash potato (you should have 1/3 cup).  Add liqueur, stir
  until smooth.  Set aside.
  
  In a 2-quart microwave-save casserole combine chocolate and margarine;
  cook, uncovered, on High for 1-2 minutes or until almost melted, stirring
  once.  Stir until smooth.
  
  Stir potato mixture into chocolate mixture.  Slowly stir in powdered sugar.
  Stir or knead until smooth.  Press into the foil-lined pan. Score into
  thirty-six 1-1/4-inch squares.  Press a walnut piece into each square.
  Cover and chill until firm.  Holding foil at edges, remove the fudge from
  the pan; cut into squares.  Drizzle Designer icing over fudge.
  
  ~=>Designer Icing In a small microwave-save bowl, cook 1 Tbsp
  margarine/butter on High for 45 seconds or until melted. Beat in 1/3 cup
  sifted powdered sugar and enough Irish Creme liqueur (1-2 Tbsp) to ake an

 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  6
 
      2 lb Skinned, blanched whole
           -almonds
           Ice water
      4    Egg whites
  2 2/3 c  Confectioners sugar
    1/2 c  Orange juice
 
  Colors: Natural, or, if necessary, artificial parsley or mallow for green
  sandalwood or alkanet for red saffron or dandelion for yellow blue turnsole
  for light blue violets for lavender
  
  1. In a mortar and pestal or a blender, grind the almonds to a thick paste.
  Add small amounts of ice water, about 1/2 tsp. at a time, to prevent the
  almonds from becoming to oily.  Place almond paste in a large mixing bowl.
  2.  In another bowl, beat egg whites until they peak.  Gradually beat in
  the sugar. 3. Add the sweetened egg whites to the almond paste. With
  fingers wet in orange juice, knead the resulting mixture. If the mixture is
  too sticky to handle, add small amounts of orange juice, 1 tsp. at a time.
  Thoroughly knead for about 10 minutes. 4. Separate the marzipan into
  several sections, on for every color required for your sculpture. 5. In a
  separate small mixing bowl for each color, place the marzipan portions and
  cover the bowl tightly with a clean cloth tied securely or with aluminum
  foil.  Allow these to ripen or "age" in refrigerator for at least 24 hours.
  (One old recipe recommends aging for a fortnight). Two days ought to
  suffice. 6. Mix the natural coloring agents, into the aged marzipan. The
  stiff confection will be easier to knead if allowed to return to room temp.
  7.  Sculpture the paste according to your wildest fancy.  Wet fingers,
  preferably in ice water.

    1/2 c  -Boiling Water
      2 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Vanilla
           Flour
    3/4 lb Chocolate for dipping
           Regal Icing
 
  Put gelatin in top of double boiler; add cold water.  When gelatin softens,
  add boiling water and stil well.  Add sugar and salt.  Put over boiling
  water and stir until sugar dissolves completely.
  
  Pour into large bowl of electric mixer and beat at high speed until misture
  is thick but not as stiff as beaten egg whites.  Add vanilla.
  
  Meanwhile, spread flour 2" deep in a large pan.  Push an egg (in shell)
  into the flour  at intervals, making hollow spaces in which to mold the
  marshmallow mixture.
  
  Drop marshmallow mixture into the flour molds.  Sprinkle flour lightly over
  top and put in cold place until set.  Remove mixture from one mold and you
  have a  half-egg.  Trim the flat side of marshmallow half-egg to make it
  even.  You can dip it in melted chocolate to cover and decorate with Regal
  Icing.
  
  Or you can put two halves together to make an egg, as follows:  Dip the
  rounded part of a half-egg in melted chocolate; set aside to cool, flat
  (uncoated) side down.  Trim flat side of second half-egg (to make it even),
  lift from mold and completely coat with chocolate.  Quickly press its flat
  side against the flat side of the cooled half-egg and you have a whole egg.
  The chocolate will hold it together.
  
  When chocolate-coated eggs are cool, trim with Regal Icing put through cake
  decorator tube.  Make ruffles around them to cover seam where the two
  halves join and to provide decoration.  Write names of children on their
  eggs with the icing, or decorate with tiny designs pressed through fine
  tips of a cake decorator tube.  Frosting my be left white or tinted in
  pastel colors.  Makes 13 eggs (or 26 half-eggs).

    3/4 c  Water
      1 pk (1 3/4-ounce) powdered fruit
           -pectin
    1/2 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 ts Orange extract
      1 ts Finely shredded orange peel
      4    Drops yellow food coloring
      1    Drop red food coloring
           Sugar
 
  Line a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan with foil, extending foil over edges of the pan.
  
  Butter the foil; set pan aside.
  
  Butter the sides of a heavy 1 1/2-quart saucepan.  In the saucepan combine
  the 1 cup sugar and the corn syrup.  Cook over medium-high heat to boiling,
  stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to dissolve sugar. This should take
  about 10 minutes.  Avoid splashing mixture on sides of pan. Carefully clip
  candy thermometer to side of pan.
  
  Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, till the thermometer
  registers 280 deg.F., soft-crack stage.  Mixture should boil at a moderate,
  steady rate over the entire surface.  Reaching soft-crack stage should take
  about 10 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, in a heavy 2-quart saucepan combine water, pectin, and baking
  soda. (Mixture will be foamy.)  Cook over high heat to boiling, stirring
  constantly. This should take about 2 minutes.  Remove saucepan from heat;
  set saucepan aside.
  
  When sugar mixture has reached soft-crack stage, remove the saucepan from
  heat; remove candy thermometer from saucepan.  Return pectin mixture to
  high heat; cook till mixture just begins to simmer.
  
  _Gradually_ pour the hot sugar mixture in a thin stream (slightly less than
  1/8-inch diameter) into the boiling pectin mixture, stirring constantly.
  This should take 1 to 2 minutes.  Cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute more.
  
  Remove saucepan from heat.  Stir in orange extract, orange peel, and yellow
  and red food colorings.  Pour candy mixture into prepared pan. Let stand
  about 2 hours or till firm.
  
  When firm, use foil to lift candy out of pan.  Use a buttered knive to cut
  candy into about 3/4-inch squares.  Roll squares in additional sugar. Store
  loosely covered.  Makes about 72 pieces.
  
  Cinnamon Gumdrops:  Prepare Orange Gumdrops as directed above, except
  substitute 3 drops oil of cinnamon and 7 drops red food coloring for the
  orange extract, orange peel, and yellow and red food colorings.
  
  Mint Gumdrops:  Prepare Orange Gumdrops as directed above, except
  substitute 3/4 teaspoon mint extract and 7 drops green food coloring for
  the orange extract, orange peel, and yellow and red food colorings.
  
  Lemon Gumdrops:  Prepare Orange Gumdrops as directed above, except
  substitute 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon extract, 1 teaspoon finely shredded lemon
  peel, and 7 drops yellow food coloring for the orange extract, orange peel,
  and yellow and red food colorings.

 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  1
 
      1    Glass jar or drinking glass
      1    Piece of cotton string
      1    Pencil or stick
      1    Paper clip
      1    Food coloring (optional)
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
           Additional sugar
 
  Tie a short piece of cotton string to the middle of the pencil or stick.
  Attach a paper clip to the end of the string for a weight.  Moisten the
  string very lightly, and roll in a bit of sugar (this will "attract" the
  sugar crystals from the syrup to the string).  Place the pencil or stick
  over the top of the glass or jar with the string hanging down inside.
  
  Heat the water to boiling, and dissolve the 2 cups of sugar into it.  For
  the biggest crystals FAST, heat the sugar-water solution a SECOND time, and
  dissolve as much additional sugar as you can into it.  Add a few drops of
  food coloring to the solution if desired.
  
  Pour the solution into the prepared glass or jar and leave undisturbed for
  a couple of days.  Depending on how much sugar you were able to dissolve
  into the water, you should start to see crystals growing in a few hours to
  a few days.

  Remove from heat and add butter.  When butter is melted, pour into a
  buttered shallow pan (about 13 x 9)
  
  When cool enough to handle, gather into a ball and pull until rather firm.
  Add vanilla while pulling.  Stretch out into a long rope and cut in 1 or 2"
  pieces.  Wrap each piece in waxed paper when hard; twist paper at both
  ends.  This will keep the candy from becoming sticky. Makes about 1-1/4
  lbs.
  
  Note:  You can tint the taffy while puling it.  Different flavors may be
  added, also in the pulling, instead of vanilla.  Pink taffy usually is
  flavored with wintergreen, white with vanilla, green with spearmint.

      Title: Stained Glass Candy
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  6
 
  3 3/4 c  White sugar
  1 1/2 c  Lily white syrup (or Karo,
           -must be colorless)
      1 c  Water
           Food coloring
           Oil based flavorings such as
           - Wiltons
           Tin foil
           Icing sugar, approximately
           - 10 cups, can be reused
           - over and over
           Sharp pair of scisors
           Candy thermometer
           Lots of volunteers to help
 
  Mix the white sugar, white syrup, and water in a medium sized pot. Add the
  food coloring you want (green for spearmint, orange for orange) Bring to a
  boil, and boil until candy thermometer reaches 300 F degrees. (Can take up
  to 20 minutes)   Stir to mix all the ingredients, but once it starts to
  boil, do not touch.  Pot must be big enough to allow for double, as it
  rises as it boils
  
  While the candy mixture is boiling, shape a large piece of tin foil by
  folding up the sides and ends.  (I use the large foil about 3 feet long) to
  create a large cookie sheet type shape.  Put the icing sugar on the foil to
  completely cover it, and bank up the sides with icing sugar.
  
  When the candy mixture has reached 300F, remove from heat.  Let sit about
  10 seconds and stir to cool slightly (heavy emphasis on SLIGHTLY) Then add
  about 1 to 1-1/2 tsp of the oil based flavorings depending on how strong
  you want the flavor.  Stir until mixed (may boil a bit and DON'T stand over
  top of pot as flavor with escape in the air and up your nose!! 8-} ) Once
  flavoring is combined, pour mixture onto the icing sugar and use rubber
  spatula to scrape all mixture out of pot.  Put pot, spatula and candy
  thermometer into sinkful of hot soapy water.  If you allow it to harden you
  won't be saying nice things about me at all!! 8-} As candy is cooling, keep
  checking by trying to pull up the edges.  Once it gets to the consistency
  that you can lift it a little, start cutting it FAST! I cut off a chunk and
  then cut it up into bite-sized pieces. The outside will cool first so you
  have to watch it.  If it hardens to quickly you will end up with a good
  size lollipop that you won't be able to cut. It will shatter like glass.
  Continue working your way around until all is cut. Then I take all the
  candy and put it in a strainer that is sitting over a bowl. Shake some of
  the excess icing sugar off candy and allow to cool thoroughly. Pack in
  airtight containers. I find Zip-Loc Freezer bags pretty good. This recipe
  makes about 2 lbs candy. Once I have done all the flavors that I want, then
  I set up all the bags and put about 10 of each flavor into a smaller
  zip-loc and seal.  They make great Christmas gifts for family and all the
  various people you give to....mailman, garbage man, paperboy, school
  teachers, your kids friends..etc.  I figure if the kids have to help me
  cut, they get some to give to their friends..  Besides.. makes a good bribe
  to get them to help!!

  Debbie Tillman's notes: Now for the changes we use. When we are going to be
  giving this as a gift, we melt another 1/2 c of chocolate in the microwave.
  Use an 7x7x2 pan (or smaller than the 9x9x2). Spread the melted chocolate
  on top of the buttered pan that is covered with the nuts.  After the
  chocolate is spread on top, sprinkle more nuts on top while chocolate is
  still warm. Then cut into small sizes. After the candy is set, remove from
  pan; wrap individually with dessert foil. I get mine at the bakery supply,
  or a craft shop.

      Title: Truffes Au Chocolat (Chocolate Truffles)
 Categories: Chocolate, Candies, Christmas
   Servings:  1
 
      3 oz Chocolate
  1 1/2 oz Butter
      2 oz Powdered sugar
      2 tb Fresh cream
 
  Preparation: Put cream, butter and grated chocolate into a pan. The
  chocolate need not be grated fine. The cream can be replaced by skimming
  the top off raw milk poured into a wide basin and allowed to settle. Melt
  butter, chocolate, and cream in a double boiler, stirring to mix well. When
  melted, remove the double boiler from the fire, leaving the hot water in
  the bottom pan to keep it warm. Sift the powdered sugar in slowly, so that
  it will not form lumps, stirring constantly. Let stand 24 hr. in a cool
  place. (In winter, 12 hr. in a cold room will do.) At the end of this time,
  cut a piece of this chocolate about the size of a small nut, using a knife
  or spoon. Roll it into a ball in the palm of the hand until the outside of
  the bonbon begins to melt a little. Then roll it in grated or granulated
  chocolate, which will stick to it perfectly. Let stand 2 hr. before
  serving, but in a place that is not too cold, because these truffles are
  better when they are a little soft. Instead of rolling them into balls, you
  can also shape them to look more like truffles.

 Categories: Chocolate, Candies, Christmas
   Servings:  1
 
    1/2 lb Good chocolate
           About 1/2 glass water
      3    Egg yolks
      3 oz Butter
  1 1/2 oz Praline paste
 
  Slowly melt the chocolate in the water, bring to a gentle boil, remove from
  the fire, and add the yolks, beating with a spatula, then replace on a low
  fire to poach the eggs in the chocolate. Do not stop beating. Remove from
  the fire and add the butter and the praline paste. Let cool, beating from
  time to time (this cooling takes a rather long time). When the mixture
  begins to solidify, take some with a spoon, place it in some grated
  chocolate (prepared in advance), and shape to resemble real truffles. These
  truffles keep a week. To keep a longer time, substitute vegetable
  shortening for the butter.

      Title: Turkish Delight
 Categories: Candies
   Servings: 49
 
      1 lb Granulated sugar
    1/4    Level tsp cream of tartar
  3 1/2 oz Cornflour
  7 1/2 oz Icing sugar
      2 oz Clear honey
      2 ts Distilled rose water
           Natural red colouring (opt)
 
  From "The Food Watch Alternative Cookbook" by Honor J Campbell.
  
  Lightly grease or oil a shallow 7" square tin.  Place granulated sugar and
  1/4 pt water in a heavy-based saucepan.  Stir over a moderate heat until
  sugar has dissolved.  Bring to boil and boil quickly, without stirring,
  until 'soft-ball' stage is reached (240 F on a sugar thermometer, or until
  a little, when dropped in  a saucer of cold water, will just form a soft
  ball).  Remove from heat, stir in cream of tartar and then leave on one
  side.  While syrup is cooling mix 3 oz  cornflour and 7 oz icing sugar in a
  large saucepan with a little cold water, taken from a measured 1 pt. Add
  remaining water.  Bring to the boil, stirring all the time and cook for 2
  min.  Reduce heat and gradually pour the cooled syrup into the cornflour
  mixture, beating well with a wooden spoon. Bring to the boil and boil for
  20-30 min over a low heat, stirring continuously, when mixture should be
  very pale straw in color and transparent.
  
  Add honey and rosewater, mix thoroughly.  Pour half the mixture into
  prepared tin.  Put a Tbs of the remainder into a cup, add a little natural
  red food coloring and mix well.  Add the colored mixture to the remainder
  left in the pan and mix well.  Pour over the mixture already in the tin.
  Leave until quite cold.  Dip a sharp knife into icing sugar and cut Turkish
  Delight into 1" bars.  Mix 1/2 oz cornflour with 1/2 oz icing sugar and
  roll bars in mixture to coat evenly.  Leave for 3-4 hours, then cut into 1"
  squares and coat again in mixture.  Leave overnight. Pack.
  
  Makes 49 pieces.

    1/2 ts Salt

      1 ts Vanilla or other flavoring
           -such as orange or lemon, or
           -use:
    1/2 ts Peppermint or:
      1 oz Bitter chocolate, grated
 
  From Grandma Ruby's recipe file: newspaper clipping
  
  Cook sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar until a few drops of the
  mixture will make a hard ball in cold water, 260 degrees on a candy
  thermometer.  Pour onto a greased dish or platter, sprinkle flavoring over
  top and turn the outer edges of the candy in toward the center until cool
  and firm enough to handle.
  
  Best results are obtained in pulling if the tips of the thumbs and fingers
  are dipped in cornstarch or fat. Use only the fingertips to pull taffy.
  When mixture can be handled, take up and pull out with both hands. Fold
  over and pull out again.
  
  As the mixture becomes cooler and the longer it is pulled, it will become
  stiffer and can be pulled out in a longer strand.  Pull until it is
  difficult to pull out and the mixture seems quite firm.
  
  Pull into long thin strips and cut immediately with greased scissors and
  roll each piece in powdered sugar or wrap in wax paper. Store cooled taffy
  in an air tight container in a cool dry place.
  
  If the taffy sugars, it can be recooked by putting it in a pan with 2
  Tablespoons corn syrup and 1/4 cup water.  Stir until dissolved and then
  recook according to original directions.
  
  Finely chopped nuts or fruit, as well as other flavorings, are added as the
  taffy is being pulled.
  
  I wish I had a date for this...I'd say recipe is at _least_ 30 years
  old...possibly 40, maybe even more...  This is a lesson to all of you to
  date your recipes, including newspaper clippings!

  Note:  It is traditional in the South to use bourbon, but rye may also be
  used. This confection -- or at least a version of it -- was an early
  Southern version of those chocolate truffles that became the rage for
  chocolate lovers during the 1980s in this country. The whiskey balls are
  made, of course, with cocoa rather than chocolate.

      1 tb Instant espresso or coffee
           -powder
     14 oz White chocolate, very finely

      2 tb Kahlua
           Dipping chocolate:

           -chopped
      2 ts Vegetable oil
      3 tb Chocolate-covered coffee
           -beans, very finely chopped
 
  1. To make the truffles: In a medium saucepan, bring the cream and espresso
  powder to a boil.  pour over the chocolate and whisk until completely
  melted.  whisk in the Kahlua. Refrigerate until completely chilled and
  firm.
  
  2. With a tsp, place pieces of the chocolate onto a foil-lined baking
  sheet.  Refrigerate to firm; roll into balls and refrigerate again for
  about 30 minutes.
  
  3. To prepare the dipping chocolate: In the top of a double boiler set over
  hot water, place the chocolate and oil. stir until almost melted. Remove
  the top of the double boiler from the heat and stir until the chocolate has
  completely melted.  continue to stir until the chocolate has cooled and
  reaches a temperature of 90 degrees.
  
  4. Prepare 2 baking sheets by lining with aluminum foil.  Dip each candy
  center in the melted chocolate, shake off the excess and place on the
  baking sheet.  When you have dipped a row of candies, top each with a
  little of the chocolate- covered coffee bean.  Before each dipping, stir
  the chocolate vigorously with your fingers.  If the centers become too
  soft, chill for about 30 minutes.
  
  5. Let the candies set for about 2 hours before storing in refrigeration.
  If the centers start to come through the bottoms of the chocolates, as
  often happens with soft mixtures, dip the bottoms again in melted and
  cooled chocolate.

1/2 lb  Monterey Jack or Chihuahua cheese, cubed
1/4     small yellow onion, coarsely chopped
1       large garlic clove, halved
6       eggs

                            Crema Fresca:
1 1/2 Cups  whipping cream
3 T.        sour cream

Make the Crema Fresca ahead of time:  mix cream and sour cream
together.  Cover and let stand at room temp. until thickened, 8 hours
or overnight.  Chill until ready to use.

Char the chili peppers over a gas flame until blackened on all sides.
Wrap them in a plastic bag and let stand for 10 minutes to steam.
Peel and core the chilies.  Remove seeds, rinse and pat dry.

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Generously butter a 9" pie pan (preferably
porcelain or stoneware with 2" sides).  Open up chili peppers and
arrange around sides of pan skin side down, point toward center of
pan, extending about 1/2" above rim.  Cover bottom of pan with
chilies.

Finely grate cheese with onion and garlic in a processor using on/off
pulses, about 30 seconds.  Add eggs and salt.  Process until smooth,
stopping to scrape down the sides, about 15 seconds.  Mix in the
Crema Fresca (the Mexican equivalent of creme fraiche).  Pour this
filling over the chilies.  Curl the edges of the chilies over the
filling.

Bake until golden brown and a knife inserted in the center comes out
clean, 45 to 50 minutes.  Cover chili edges with foil to prevent
burning, if necessary.  Cool for 5 minutes before cutting.  Serve hot
or at room temperature.

                        NEW MEXICAN CHILI

1/3 C   corn oil
3       large onions, chopped
6       large garlic cloves, minced
5 T     mild ground chiles, preferably New Mexican
1 tsp   HOT ground chiles or Cayenne pepper (more for hotter)
2 T     ground cumin
1 lb    lean pork, ground
5 lb    boneless beef chuck, trimmed of fat, cubed 1/2"-3/4"
2 tsp   oregano
2 1/2 t salt
1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper
28 oz   Italian plum tomatoes, canned, with juice
24 oz   good amber beer (New Amsterdam, Dos Equis)
13 oz   beef broth
2       bay leaves
34 oz   kidney beans

In a large flame-proof casserole or stockpot, heat the oil.  Add the
onions.  Cover and cook over moderate heat for 5 minutes.  Uncover,
increase heat to moderately high and cook, stirring frequently, until
the onions begin to brown, 5 to 10 minutes.

Add the garlic and cook another 1 or 2 minutes, until fragrant.  Add
the chiles and cumin.  Cook, stirring, 1 minute then add the pork,
mashing and stirring, until the meat browns and begins to separate.

Add the beef, oregano, salt and pepper.  Increase heat to high and
cook, stirring frequently, until the meat loses most of its redness,
about 10 - 15 minutes.

Add the tomatoes and their liquid, the beer, beef broth and bay
leaves.  Bring to a boil, partially cover and reduce heat to
moderate.  Cook until the beef is very tender and the sauce is
reduced to a chili-like consistency, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

In a medium saucepan, heat the beans in the liquid from the cans.
Drain when hot and either add to the chili or serve on the side along
with other accompaniments such as steamed rice, sour cream, grated
cheddar cheese, thinly sliced scallions, onions, or chips.

FAJITAS COLLECTION
Here, as promised, is the collection of Fajitas recipes that I have managed 
to put together, ranging from the quick-and-easy to the wonderfully 
elaborate.  Thanks to all those who sent me their recipes or 
collections.  I have tried to list the author's names beside their
contribution, but this was not always possible (apologies to those I 
have missed).  

Bon appetite all,
Ward Tomlinson
tomlinson@neurophys.wisc.edu


--------- FAJITAS 1

Well, I wing my fajitas every time I do them, but here's a guess at the
measurements.

2 Tablespoons oil
1 1/2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thighs cut in thin slices
1 large onion, cut in slivers from pole to pole
1 green bell pepper, cut in slivers pole to pole
1 red bell pepper, cut (you guess it) in slivers pole to pole
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 Tablespoons chili powder
3 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon black pepper
ground red pepper (to taste)
salt (to taste)
flour tortillas

In a large wok, warm the oil.  Cook the chicken slices until done, stir
regularly.  Add everything except tortillas.  Mix well.  Cook covered. 
Stir every few minutes.  It's done when the peppers are tender and the
vegetables are starting to get browned in spots.  Serve with warmed flour
tortillas.  (I warm them individually in the microwave for 20 secs.)

Additional toppings for the fajitas can include salsa, sour cream,
avacados, and tomatos.  To me cheese is a sacrilege; but, to each his own.

NOTE:  My grocer carries "fajita tortillas".  These are smaller and
thicker than ones I would use for burritos.  They hold up much better with
the fajita filling.

NOTE 2:  If tortillas are not handy, use pita halves.  They work great.

--------- FAJITAS 2

Fajitas are marinated skirt steak. This is the diaphragm muscle
in the cow. Anything else is NOT a true fajita.

INGREDIENTS
1 skirt steak for each 4 people ( this is the diaphragm muscle)
Kraft Zesty Italian Salad Dressing.

Flour tortillas
Refried beans
Guacamole
Grated cheddar cheese
diced tomatoes
Salsa

Marinate skirt steak in enough salad dressing to cover meat,
for a full 24 Hours, NOT LESS!

grill steak over charcoal (mesquite is best)

slice steak with the grain into thin strips

warm tortilla (works great to wrap in Saran wrap and heat in microwave)
spread some beans down center of tortilla, add some meat, top with
other condiments, roll into a tube and enjoy.


Not bad, but if you live in a part of the country where you can get "real"
Mexican food products, you can marinate the meat in something called "mojo
criollo". This comes in bottles and consists of oil, vinegar and an
assortment of other spices. It's specifically for this kind of use. It's
available in most Supermarkets around here.

Tom's recipe mentions a couple of important points:
1) Marinate the meat overnight at least. It makes a big difference. You
can also do this with skinless, boneless chicken breasts.

2) Slice the meat *after* cooking, not before. The pre-cut beef and chicken
products "for fajitas" you see some places just don't come up to snuff.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------- FAJITAS 3:  (from USENET cookbook)

Fajitas originated in Texas as a way to make cheap meat
palatable.  Unfortunately, it was too successful. It is
still palatable, but because the word is out that fajitas
are so delicious, the meat isn't cheap any more. Because
this is not a traditional Mexican dish but a recent inven-
tion of Mexican immigrants, there is no fixed formula for
it. Many different Kinds of marinade are used; this one is
adapted from a recipe given to a friend over the phone by
Tortuga's in Austin, Texas.

INGREDIENTS (serves 8)
     3 lb      skirt steak
     2         large yellow onions
     2 Tbsp    vegetable oil
     16        flour or whole-wheat tortillas
     2 cups    grated cheese
     3 cups    guacamole
	  MARINADE
     1 cup     lime juice
     1 Tbsp    ground black pepper
     2 Tbsp    garlic, minced
	  PICO DE GALLO
     1/2 cup   fresh cilantro, chopped
     2         scallions, chopped (green onions)
     2         large tomatoes, chopped
     1 tsp     garlic, minced

PROCEDURE
  (1)  Combine marinade ingredients in a large glass baking dish.

          (2)  Peel the fatty membrane from both sides of the
       skirt Steak. This requires a very sharp knife. Add
       meat to marinade and marinate for at least 4
       hours, preferably overnight. Keep it in the refri-
       gerator if you marinate overnight.

          (3)  Make the pico de gallo: combine all of the
       ingredients in a small serving bowl.

          (4)  Slice the yellow onions into 1/4-inch slices, and
       cut each slice into a semicircle. Grill the meat
       until  it is cooked slightly less than the way you
       like it. Meanwhile, saute' the onions in the oil
       until they are soft. Use a large frying pan that
       will have enough room for the meat later.

          (5)  After removing the meat from the grill, slice it
       into strips that are cut across the grain. The
       strips should be 3-4 inches long and 1/4 inch
       thick. Add the strips to the onions in the pan,
       and fry for another minute or two.

          (6)  Place on the table the pan full of meat, the bowl
       of pico de gallo, a basket with the tortillas, a
       bowl with the guacamole, and a bowl with the
       grated cheese. You may wish to provide picante
       sauce in addition.

          (7)  Each person makes their own fajita by taking a tor-
       tilla, spooning some of the meat onto it, then
       adding their choice of each of the other ingredients
       in whatever combination they want.

NOTES
     Skirt steak is somewhat like flank steak: somewhat tough,
     and with a very stringy texture. It is covered on both sides
     with a fatty membrane that must be removed or the meat will
     be very tough. The key to good fajitas is the proper removal
     of this membrane.

     Fresh-squeezed lime juice is best, but bottled will do.

     Some people from out of state choose to put sour cream on
     their fajitas.

 Time: 45 minutes preparation, several hours marinating, 
10 minutes cooking.  Precision: no need to measure.

FAJITAS 5: Shrimp Fajitas

None of the recipes I've tried seemed worth posting, until this
one.  It's so darned good, I had to share it.  

1 pound shrimp, shelled
1 cup lightly packed chopped cilantro
1 clove garlic, pressed
1/3 cup lime juice
4-6 flour tortillas
1 Tbsp vegetable oil
2 green bell peppers, sliced
1 onion, sliced
1/2 cup plain non-fat yogurt
green salsa (optional)

Marinate shrimp in lime juice with garlic and cilantro for 20
minutes at room temperature.  Warm tortillas in foil in oven.
Heat oil in skillet and saute bell peppers and onions for 10
minutes, stirring occasionally.  Take vegetables out and put
shrimp with juice in.  Cook on high heat about 3 minutes until
done (cut to test, should be opaque in center).  Put vegetables
back in pan, warm them up, add yogurt.  Place mixture on flour
tortillas, roll them up, and top with salsa.

This recipe came from a cookbook which I think was entitled
"Light & Lively" by Sunset...something like that.  As you can 
see, it is a low-fat as well as nutritious meal.  Yum yum!

--------- FAJITAS 6

I have a very easy recipe that I use (I think I got it from the back
of the tortilla package).

Marinate strips of steak and or chicken in Italian Dressing for a couple
of hours.  (I have marinated over night)

Cook meat in hot skillet in a little bit of oil.  Add green pepper,
red pepper and onions (that have been sliced).  Add the rest of marinade
to the skillet and cook until the veg. are tender and the meat is done.
You can season with garlic, but I find the seasoning in the dressing
to be fine.

Serve on warmed tortillas with chopped lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream.

YUMMY! and its real easy.

--------- FAJITAS 7

  LIME JUICE is our basic fajitas recipe.  Marinate the beef or chicken 
in lots of lime juice, at least a few hours.  Then we grill (if it's a fillet)
or saute (if it's strips or raining), sauteeing usually with cumin.

To serve:  my husband prefers plain meat with some fresh coriander leaves
added as he wraps in tortillas.  I want more vegies so I usually sautee
onions and peppers, usually with lots of cumin and some garlic, but the 
spices varies.  I also eat the fajitas with the fresh coriander, yogurt, 
and maybe chopped tomatoes or some salsa. 

The fresh coriander is essential for us.

--------- FAJITAS 8:  Real Tex-Mex Fajitas

This is a fajita recipe by one of my dad's college buddies, Abel
Garcia, a native Texan.  The quantities are party-sized.

10 lbs. fajitas (flank or skirt steak)
4 lemons or limes plus rinds
1 can beer or wine
1 6oz can pineapple juice
2 tbsp vinegar
2 tbsp tenderizer
2 sweet onions, sliced (not diced)
8 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp lemon pepper
1 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp oregano
1 tsp black pepper

Mix all the ingredients of the marinade together, then trim the meat.
Marinade the meat overnight (we put it in big ziplock bags) in the
refrigerator.  

Cook over a hot fire on the grill til medium.  Grill the onions too, 
if you like (fresh sliced bell peppers are also good).  Have the 
buffet ready when you start grilling the meat:  tortillas, diced 
tomatoes and onions, refried beans, guacamole, sour cream, grated 
cheese, pico de gallo, salsa, etc.  While the meat is still hot 
off the grill, slice it into strips and serve.

------------FAJITAS  9   Fajitas on the Grill
from the "El Paso Chili Company's Texas Border Cookbook" 
by Park and Norma Kerr

Here is a grand mixed fajitaparrilla ("grill"~skirt steak, lobster, chicken, 
and shrimp--a real party. On simpler occasions we halve the marinade 
and use just one or two of the main components.
     Two practical notes: The live lobsters can be replaced with 4 defrosted 
frozen lobster tails, slightly undercooked according to the directions on 
the package. And, although some grill manufacturers warn against heavy 
basting, Park has always just dumped all the remaining marinade over the 
fajitas on the grill (the fuming cloud of steam and smoke is full of flavor) 
and he reports it has not harmed his grill.

2 1/4 pounds (2 or 3 pieces) skirt steak
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, halved 
      and trimmed of fat and connective tissue
1 pound (about 18) large shrimp, shelled and deveined
2 live lobsters (about 1 1/2 pounds each)

2 Tbsp plus 1 tsp salt
2 cups tomato-based bottled hot salsa
1 cup chopped red onion
1 cup packed fresh cilantro (stems may be used)
4 fresh jalapeno chiles, stemmed and chopped
1/4 C gold tequila
1/4 C fresh lime juice
1 cup amber beer, such as Dos Equis

24 6-inch flour tortillas, warmed
Pico de Gallo
Guacamole

     Bring a very large pot of water to a boil. Stir in 2 tablespoons 
salt, add the lobsters, and cook them, stirring once or twice, for 10 
minutes. The lobsters' tails, when straightened, should snap back in place, 
and the lobster meat should be almost fully cooked. Cool the lobsters to 
room temperature in a colander. Crack open the claws and body shell and 
remove the lobster meat in pieces as large as possible. The lobsters can be 
cooked up to 1 day in advance. Wrap the meat and refrigerate it.
     In a food processor, working in batches if necessary, puree together the 
salsa, red onions, cilantro, jalapenos, tequila, lime juice, and 1 teaspoon salt. 
Stir in the beer. In two or three shallow nonreactive dishes, combine the lobster 
meat, skirt steaks, chicken breasts, and shrimp with the marinade. Cover and 
let them stand at room temperature, stirring once or twice, for 2 hours. Thread 
the shrimp on skewers.
     Preheat a gas grill (medium-high) or light a charcoal fire and let it burn down 
until the coals are evenly white. Position the rack about 6 inches from the heat 
source. Lay the skirt steaks on the grill and spoon half the marinade over the meat. 
Lower the cover and cook 7 minutes. Turn the steaks. Lay the chicken breasts, 
lobster meat, and skewered shrimp on the grill, baste everything with the remaining 
marinade (there will be steam and smoke), and cover the grill. Cook another 7 minutes,
turning the chicken breasts, lobster meat, and shrimp at the halfway point, or until the 
steaks are medium-rare and the chicken, shrimp, and lobster are lightly browned 
and cooked through.
     Transfer the steaks and chicken breasts to a cutting board, tent them with foil, 
and let them rest 10 minutes. Keep the shrimp warm. Slice the lobster pieces 
about l/2-inch thick and keep them warm. Carve the steak and chicken breasts 
across the grain and at a slight angle into l/4-inch slices. Arrange the steak, chicken, 
lobster, and shrimp on a warmed platter and serve immediately, accompanied 
by the warmed tortillas, pico de gallo, and guacamole.


-----------FAJITAS 10  Winter Fajitas
from the "El Paso Chili Company's Texas Border Cookbook" 
by Park and Norma Kerr

These indoor fajitas are for the dead of winter, when the grill is 
buried under a snowdrift, or for any time, really, when you just don't 
want to cook outdoors. This marinade is slightly different from the 
one we use for our grilled fajitas (above), it boosts the flavor with chipotles 
and liquid smoke flavoring to make up for the lack of an open flame. 
Cook these in one or two heavy cast-iron skillets or on a large ridged cast-
iron grill pan that will fit across two burners. (Those cute little fajita skillets 
that come with a wood or wicker holder are useless for cooking on, but two or 
three can be preheated and used as serving pieces.) Be sure to turn off the 
smoke alarm before setting out to make this recipe.

2 l/2 to 3 pounds skirt steak, cut into -inch sections
Nonstick cooking spray
1 large onion (about 1 pound), peeled, halved, and cut into thin slices
2 large heavy sweet red peppers, stemmed, cored, and cut into julienne strips
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup tomato-based bottled hot salsa
1/2 C chopped red onion
1/2 C packed fresh cilantro (stems can be used)
1/4 cup olive oil
3 chipotles adobado, with clinging sauce
2 Tbsp tequila
2 Tbsp fresh lime juice
1 Tbsp liquid hickory smoke flavoring
1/2 C amber beer, such as Dos Equis

18 6-inch flour tortillas, warmed
Pico de Gallo
Guacamole

note: "chipotles abobabo" are pickled peppers in tomato sauce

     In a food processor, puree the salsa, red onions, cilantro, 2 tablespoons of 
the olive oil, the chipotles, tequila, lime juice, and liquid smoke. Stir in the beer. 
In a shallow nonreactive dish, pour the marinade over the skirt steak and let it stand 
at room temperature, covered, turning it once or twice, for 2 hours.
     Heat one or two heavy cast-iron skillets or a cast-iron stove-top grill pan over 
medium-high heat. When they are very hot, lightly coat the skillets with nonstick 
cooking spray. Letting the excess marinade drip off, and working in batches if necessary, 
place the meat in the skillets. Cook, turning once or twice, until browned on the outside 
and medium-rare inside, 4 to S minutes per side. Transfer the meat to a cutting board 
and let it rest for 10 minutes.
    Meanwhile, in a large heavy skillet over medium heat, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons 
of olive oil. Stir in the onions and sweet red peppers, season with salt, and cook, covered, 
stirring once or twice, for 8 minutes.
    Cut the meat, across the grain and at a slight angle, into thin slices. Add the meat 
and any juices from the cutting board to the skillet with the onions and peppers. Raise 
the heat to high and cook uncovered, tossing and stirring, until the meat is heated through 
and the onions and peppers are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to heated fajita 
pans or a large heated platter and serve immediately, accompanied by warmed tortillas, 
pico de gallo, and guacamole.


----------FAJITAS 11     BEEF FAJITAs

Ingredients:

Beef skirt steaks (you may have to ask the butcher for these outside the 
Southwest; they are inexpensive and readily available in the prime fajita areas 
of the country such as Texas) [Note that you can use flank steak if forced to 
but it just doesn't taste the same.]

Flour tortillas 

For the meat marinade:

Olive or other vegetable oil as preferred and about an equal amount of fresh 
lime juice (or a combination lime juice and white vinegar); salt; pepper to 
taste; minced garlic or garlic powder

Accompaniments:

salsa, raw sliced onions, shredded mild cheese, diced tomatoes, shredded 
lettuce, sour cream, etc.


First, marinate the skirt steaks in the oil/lime juice mixture as described 
above. Overnight in the refrigerator works well using a ziploc bag.  The amount 
of marinade depends on the amount of meat. [The lime juice imparts an 
incredibly sweet and fresh taste to the meat; you will love the effect.]

Prepare your accompaniments and have them ready for guests to use according to 
their own preferences.  Some people fry onions (instead of using them raw) and 
others cook some green pepper as accompaniments.  I personally think that this 
detracts from a simple fresh taste, but hey this is food, not medicine...

Grill the fajitas outside (over wood charcoal if you can get it)--over a medium 
hot fire this will require about 10 minutes a side.  After grilling, allow the 
skirt steaks to sit for a couple of minutes, then slice across the grain in 
relatively thin slices. 

Warm the flour torillas slightly (microwave will do nicely if you aren't a 
purist).

Allow people to assemble the fajitas themselves:  slices of meat rolled in the 
torillas together with accompaniments of their choice.  You may also want to 
have some hot pepper sauce and cilantro also at the ready.


This is a "can't lose" company dish; the meat when re-heated tastes good as 
left-overs as well.

Well, several people asked for this list of recipes so here it is.  Now you'll
know what to do next time you happen upon a herd of cows in a meadow at 10,000 
ft :-).  Having started a batch last night, I have a suggestion of my own to 
add: if this is your first batch, make sure you have some store-bought
jerky on hand for the inevitable feeding frenzy resulting from the aroma 
given off by the dehydrator.  If you're on a diet, you might consider going
elsewhere while it's running because I think I put on 10 lbs just from 
breathing the air :-).   For those who wanted to know, my dehydrator is
the el-cheapo K-TEL model.  I expect they're all pretty much the same since
the principle involved is very simple, but I won't be surprised when the
marketing people develop a 16-valve double overhead cam turbocharged model.

And thanks once again to those who sent in their recipes.

We've made Jerky for years from beef and venison, and I believe
this will work for almost any kind of meat.

We cut the meat into thin strips, the thinner the strips the
crunchier the jerky comes out, maybe 1/4 " thick will make chewy
jerky.  By the way, cut all the fat off the meat as you're
stripping.

Lay out the strips on a cookie sheet lined with foil, turned up
at the edges so juice won't get over everything.  Lay out in
rows and a single layer.  Sprinkle liberally with black coarse
ground pepper and seasoned salt, or spices that you like the
taste of.

Set the oven to WARM, and leave in the oven overnite, or 8-10
hrs. This causes very slow drying.  Store in a plastic
container, jar, or can after well cooled.  Too much moisture
left in the meat will cause mold, and putting it away while warm
will cause sweating inside the container.

  -------------------------------------------

~Title: Blue Ribbon Jerky

  1/2   cup  dark soy sauce
  2     Tbs  Worcestershire sauce
  1     tsp  monosodium glutamate (optional)
  1/2   tsp  onion powder
  1/2   tsp  garlic powder
  1/4   tsp  powdered ginger
  1/4   tsp  Chinese Five-Spice Powder
  3     lbs  lean beef brisket, eye-of-round or flank steak,
             trimmed completely of fat and cut across grain into
             slices 1/8 inch thick*

Blend all ingredients except meat in small bowl.  Dip each piece
of meat into marinade, coating well.  Place in shallow dish.
Pour remaining marinade over top, cover and refrigerate
overnight.

Oven method:  Preheat oven to lowest setting (preferably 110 F).
 Place several layers of paper towels on baking sheets.  Arrange
meat in single layer on prepared sheets and cover with
additional toweling.  Flatten meat with rolling pin.  Discard
towels and set meat directly on oven racks.  Let dry 8 to 12
hours (depending on temperature of oven).

Dehydrator method:  Arrange meat on trays in single layer and
dehydrate 10 to 12 hours, depending on thickness.

Store jerky in plastic bags or in tightly covered containers in
cool, dry area.

*To aid in slicing meat thinly, freeze until ice crystals are
formed.


~Title: Chinese Beef Jerky

       3  Lbs.   Flank Steak or London Broil

   MARINADE

     1/2  Cup Light Soya Sauce
   4 1/2  Tbs Honey

   1 1/2  Tbs Ginger Fresh Minced
   1 1/2  Tbs Red Pepper crushed
   1 1/2  Tbs Sesame Oil
          Dash White Pepper

Cut meat in half, lengthwise and slice diagonally crosswise into
paper thin strips 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide and 4 inches long.
Transfer to shallow pan. Combine marinade ingredients and rub
thoroughly into meat.  Arrange meat on racks and let dry at cool
room temperature overnight (do not refrigerate).

Preheat oven to 250 F. Line two large baking sheets with foil
and set wire racks on top of each baking sheet. Arrange meat on
racks in single layer. Bake 30 minutes.

Reduce heat to 175 F and continue drying meat another 40
minutes.  Meat should be lightly brown but not burnt. Let meat
continue to dry on racks at cool room temperature overnight
before packing into jars.

Dried meat can be brushed lightly with sesame oil for additional
flavor and shine. Makes about 36 pieces.

SEVEN STEP JERKY

Basic ingredients are: garlic powder, onion powder, onion powder, black
pepper, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt, Accent.  Also
knife and pan or bowl.

Slice three pounds of venison into strips about 3/8 inch thick to ensure
total saturation of the meat while it's marinating.  In container, combine
1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup Worchestershire, 2 tsp. Accent, 2 tsp. seasoned
salt, 2/3 tsp. garlic powder, 2 tsp. onion powder, adn 2/3 tsp. black
pepper.

Stir this mixture well with a spoon to dissolve all of the soluble
ingredients.  Now the marinaade is ready to be used.

Place the strips of meat in the marinade be sure they're completely
submerged.  Marinate overnight, turning if necessary.

Lay marinated meat strips on oven rack.  Cook for 6 to 8 (6 is better) at
150 degrees.  They get crisper the longer they bake.

Store finished jerky in zip-lock bags or other airtight containers to seal
in freshness.  Jerky will keep up to two years.



A good book on making beef jerky and other light-weight foods is:

    THE HUNGRY HIKERS BOOK OF GOOD COOKING
      by GRETCHEN McHUGH
       published by Alfred Knopf 1989
       ISBN 0-394-51261-8


just to give you the section on jerky, in case you don't find it,
quoting directly from the book::


   to make jerky, take a raw piece of beef round or chuck, quite lean
and slice it thin, across the grain.  Lay the slices across the racks
of the dryer for two days and nights -- test it by breaking a piece,
it is dry enough when it cracks in two when you break it. The smaller
and thinner you cut the pieces of meat before drying them, the quicker
they will get tender as you soak and cook them

(remember, its easier to slice thinly if the steak is partially frozen)
    One pound of sliced beef dries to 4 ounces of jerky, making
    a ratio of undried to dried meat of about 4:1.

Before drying the meat, you can season it with some combination of the
following spices: paprika, pepper, salt, or other concoctions like
lemon pepper or seasoned salt.  Garlic is wonderful on jerky.  I recommend
rubbing the meat with cut cloves of garlic before slicing it.

A marinade will change the taste slightly, and cause the meat to take longer
to dry.  Marinating tenderizes the meat however, acid in soy sauce and
wine, breaks down the tissues of the meat.


      SIMPLE MARINADE FOR BEEF JERKY


for 3lbs of lean beef:

   2 tablespoons soy sauce
   1/4 teaspoon salt
   2 drops of tabasco, or cayenne
    pepper to taste,
   ground pepper
    1 fresh garlic clove, minced

  slice the beef as thin as you can across the grain
 mix the marinade ingredients, put the meat in the mixture and
refrigerate for at least 12 hours, 2 days if possible.

 pat the meat dry, and set it on the dryer racks for 2-3 days. (check by
snapping a piece)

note for a stew or stirfry, cut beef into very thin strips 3-4 inches long,
for snack jerky simply slice the steak very thin.


      WINE MARINADE FOR BEEF JERKY

  for 2 pounds of lean beef (chuck, round, sirloin)

  1/2 cup red wine
  1 tablspoon red wine vinegar
  1 tablespoon olive oil
  2 fresh garlic cloves, minced
  2 tablespoons minced onion
  1 bay leaf
  pepper
  pinch each of thyme, oregano, and marjoram

slice the beef across the grain as thin as you can
mix the marinade ingredients, put meat in the mixture, and refrigerate
(12 hours -- to 2 days if possible)
as above, pat the meat dry, place on racks and dry for 2-3 days
(Note up here, meat drys within a day -- must be a difference in
humidity -- I find the snap test the best way to check, rather than
relying on number of hours drying time)

a couple of extra notes  --

before stir frying jerky, soak for 30 minutes, before using in a stew
soak it as long as you can, at least an hour

and pack dental floss or toothpicks  (Im sure you know this part!!)

anyway  --- hope this helps  -- I highly recommend the book, we
find it an excellent source of lightweight, filling recipes for
canoe trips -- and the jerky stirfry is usually a highlight of
any trip

I make up a lot of my own marinades -- one that works well is simply
honey mixed with minced garlic and soy sauce
lemon juice, brown sugar, and a little salt
(I usually through things
in until it tastes right)

or if you like thai food -- try mixing a peanut type marinade  -- we
love this one  -- peanut butter, with water, indonesian or sweet soy sauce,
sambal (red pepper sauce), lemon juice, -- just mix over low heat until
you have a sauce consistency and the taste seems right -- this is
excellent for stirfrys
anyway, experiment almost anything will work -- and its a lot cheaper and
a lot tastier than the stuff you buy (thats why we got into it in the
first place too)
cheers!

Biltong is a South African version of beef jerky.


Biltong is usually made from venison, beef or ostrich meat (the latter may
pose a problem to you, as would elephant biltong which is readily available
in RSA and in my view the most delish...) and during the cool, dry months
of the year (do you have any cool, dry periods?). Now that I live in Oz I
tend to use beef - the tender cuts are the best, fillet, rump and sirloin,
it is not cheap!

For every 25kg of meat allow
    1.25kg good salt,
    250ml brown sugar,
    50ml bicarb of soda,
    20ml salpetre,
    25ml ground pepper,
    100g coarsely ground coriander seed.

Cut meat across the grain into 5 - 7cm thick strips, trying to leave some
fat on each piece. Mix salt, sugar, bicarb, saltpetre and coriander and rub
this into the strips of meat. Layer meat in plastic or enamel container and
sprinkle a little vinegar over each layer. Leave for 24 - 48 hours. Dip
meat into a mixture of 500ml vinegar and 5 litres water. Pat dry, then hang
on s - shaped wire hooks about 5cm apart, free air circulation, for 2 - 3
weeks. If weather is not cool, make strips about 2cm thick. When dry (the
degree of dryness is a matter of personal taste) slice thinly and serve
with beer.
enjoy!

This is the first part of my jerkey summary...a few people had asked
for the recipies that I got.   I didn't get very many responses, but
thanks to those of you who were kind enough to reply.  Special thanks
to Bob (you know who you are) who sent me a bunch of recipies.  Anyway,
I'm going to post all of them, but only a few at a time, to build the
anticipation.  Since all the methods are essentially the same, I'll
put the method in first, followed by the various ingredient lists.

For measurements, tblsp = tablespoon and tsp =  teaspoon.

General jerkey method:

All recipies use 1 lb lean meat, thinly sliced. (3/16-1/4 in thick)

In a small glass bowl, combine all ingredients except meat.  Stir to mix
well.  Place meat 3-4 layers deep in a container, spooning sauce mixture
over each layer.  Cover tightly and marinate 6-12 hours in the 'fridge,
stirring occasionally and keeping the mixture covered.

I can't really help with drying instructions, but i'd say somewhere between
7-10 hours, depending on how you like it.

_The Recipies_

Mild Mexican Jerky
1 tsp salt               1/2 tsp crushed oregano
1/4 tsp pepper           1 tsp paprika
1 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder

Hawaiian Jerky
1 tsp salt                1 crushed garlic clove
1 tsp ground ginger       1/4 cup pineapple juice
1 tbs brown sugar         1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 tsp papper
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper

Korean Jerkey
1/2 tsp salt              1 tbs dry sherry (if desired)
1/4 tsp pepper            2 tbs sesame seeds
2 tsp sugar               1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tsp MSG (if desired)

Hot & Tangy Jerky
1 tsp salt                2 cloves crushed garlic
1/4 tsp cracked pepper    2 tbs A-1 sauce
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper    3 tbs Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp onion powder        1/2 tsp paprika

Middle Eastern Jerky
1 tsp salt                1/4 tsp turmeric
1/8 tsp pepper            1/8 tsp ground cumin
1--1/2 tsp coriander      1/4 tsp chili powder
1/4 tsp ground ginger

Fiesta Jerky
1 tsp salt                1 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp pepper            1/4 tsp ground cumin
1 tbs chili powder        1 tsp garlic powder


That's it for this post.  Still 7 recipies left to go, but my
fingers are getting tired.  And it's dinner time.  The only
recipie I've tried so far is the one for Hot & Tangy jerky, and
it's pretty good.  hopefully I'll be able to try the rest of them
when I have more time.

Hope you enjoy 'em.
Again, thanks to those who responded, and special thanks to Bob for
sending all the recipies I'm working on posting.

I've had a food dehydrator for about a year now, and have used it extensively
for backpacking foods. Nearly everything I've tried works great.

Here are all the recipes I've gotten from the net. There are some recipes
for jerked chicken at the end.

BTW I have never dried fowl in the dehydrator. I'm not sure whether it is
safe to do it or not because of samonella (sp?). If you have or get any
info on drying fowl, please send it along.

Happy drying!

I have a book by Helen Willinsky called Jerk: Barbecue from Jamaica.

I have so many recipes online now that I'm searching for some jerk

I'm taking the liberty of answering even though I have /three/ recipes for it.

  -------------------------------------------
  GRILLED JAMAICAN JERK CHICKEN

  1/4 cup Inner Beauty, or other Caribbean hot sauce, or 10 pureed Scotch
          Bonnet chile pepper, or 15 of your favorite fresh chile peppers
  2 tbsp dried rosemary
  2 tbsp parsley, chopped
  2 tbsp dried basil
  2 tbsp dried thyme
  2 tbsp mustard seeds
  3 scallions, finely chopped
  1 tsp salt
  1 tsp black pepper
  juice of 2 limes
  1/4 cup cheap yellow mustard
  2 tbsp orange juice
  2 tbsp white vinegar
  6 chicken thighs, with legs attached

Combine all the rub ingredients in a food processor, or blender, and
blend them into a paste, making sure that all the ingredients are fully
integrated.  The paste should be approximately the consistency of a thick
tomato sauce.  If it is too thick, thin it out with a little more white
viegar.  Cover the paste and let it sit n the refrigerator for at least 2
hours for the flavors to blend together.  Overnight is the ideal amount
of time to give them to get acquainted. (**NOTE** If you want to avoid
making a fresh batch every time you make this dish, you can multiply the
amount of paste easily.  Don't worry about it going bad, since it keeps
almost infinetely.)

Rub the chicken thighs with paste and place them on the grill over very
low heat.  If you have a covered cooker, put the coals to one side and
the chicken on the other, and cover.

Cook about 1 hour without a cover or 1/2 hour if covered.  The key here
is to use a very low heat.  You need to be patient and give yourself
plenty of time.  The chicken is technically done when the meat is opaque
and the juices run clear.  However, the ideal is about 10-15 minutes past
that point, when the meat pulls away from the bone easily.  It is very
hard to overcook this.  In fact you can only screw it up if you burn the
paste by having the heat too high.  The longer the chicken stays on the
grill, the more superior the smoky flavor.  After cooking, separate the
leg from the thigh by cutting at the natural joint between them.  Serve
one leg or thigh per person accompanied by a few spoonfuls of
Banana-guava ketchup.

Serves 4 and as entree or 6 as a light meal.

  Title: JAMAICAN JERK SAUCE

  1/2 cup Ground Allspice
  1/2+ cup Brown Sugar
  6 - 8 Garlic cloves
  4 - 6 Scotch Bonnet Peppers (or equivalent) seeds and all
  1 TB ground Thyme, or 2 TB thyme leaves
  2 bunches Scallions
  1 tsp Cinnamon
  1/2 tsp Nutmeg
  Soy sauce to moisten (2 TBS)

Put everything in a food processor and blend until smooth. You may
 use allspice berries, if available, but use enough to give the
 equivalent of 1/2 cup ground. This will keep "forever" in the
 refrigerator. Feel free to increase the garlic, and the hot peppers.
 I do. The recipe, double, and triples very well.

Rub about 1/4 cup sauce into each chicken, halved, and get under the
 skin and in all the cavities. It is is pork, use a de-boned
 shoulder, score the fat, and rub the sauce in, using 1/2 cup, or
 more, per 6 lb shoulder. Use less for fish.

Marinate, preferably overnight, and grill over a low fire, until
 done. Charcoal is ideal. The meat will be a smoky pink when done,
 and the skin nice and dark. Chop the meat into pieces, and serve
 traditionally with a hard-dough bread, and LOTS of Red Stripe Beer!

My favorite (and easy) jerky recipe is:

1 part liquid smoke
2 parts worchestershire sauce
4 parts soy sauce
black pepper to taste

trim favorite meat and slice 1/4' thick marinate overnight and dry.  I have a
dehydrator, but the Joy of Cooking says you can dry jerky in the oven by
setting in to 170 degrees and hanging the strips from the racks.  I haven't
tried this.  I assume you need to prop the door open to release the moisture.

Atlast, the long awaited continuation to the jerky summary.  It seems
that a few people couldn't wait for the rest of the recepies (sp?) and
got a bit...over-anxious...so...here's the rest of what i have...again,
many thanks to Bob  for sending 'em to me...

Curried Jerky
1 tsp salt               1-1/2 tsp curry powder
1/4 tsp pepper           1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/8 tsp cinnamon         1 tsp ground ginger
1/16 tsp ground cloves   1/8 tsp ground cumin

Frontier Jerky
1 tsp salt               2 tbs liquid smoke
1/4 tsp pepper           1 tsp garlic powder
2 tbs Worcestershire sauce

Great Jerky
3/4 tsp salt              2 tbs soy sauce
1/4 tsp cracked pepper    1 tbs Worcestershire sauce
1 tbs brown sugar         1 clove crushed garlic

Teriyaki Jerky
1/2 tsp salt              1/4 cup soy sauce
1/8 tsp pepper            1/2 tsp ground ginger
2 tbs brown sugar

and finally....Bob's Own Beef Jerky
I haven't tried this one yet, but i think i will when i have the
time to go hunting around for more spices...

Bob's Beef Jerky

4 tbs soy sauce          4 tbs Worcestershire sauce
4 tbs teriyaki sauce     1/2 tsp liquid smoke
1 tbs corriander         1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp pepper
1 tbs ketchup (he uses hot ketchup)

He suggests playing around with it.  Adding more pepper or garlic.
Maybe a bit of red wine.  Or anything else that sounds good.

Anyway....that's it...so far I've been pretty happy with things so
far.  And the dried fruit is great too...the fresh stuff works best.
Much better than processed stuff from a can.

Anyway...have fun...I did.

Original-From: <mhalley%MUN.BITNET@CORNELLC.CCS.CORNELL.EDU>

Ye Olde Batte's PROVEN Recipes

Basic Metheglyn

(Took First Prize at Homebrewers Competition) Put three pounds (1 quart) light
honey to about a gallon of water and heat to just below boiling.  Skim off as
much as you can of the white froth & discard.  Add a palmful of whole cloves,
a handful of stick cinnamon, and a couple of palmfuls of whole allspice.  Add
the zest (thin outer peel) of one medium-large orange.  Remove and discard the
white pith from the orange and crush the remainder into the pot.  Add one cup
double-strength black tea (two teabags to one cup boiling water).  Keep the
whole mess at steaming (NOT BOILING) temperature for two to five hours.  Cool
to lukewarm ("baby-bottle" or "blood" temperature) and strain or rack (siphon)
into one or two large bottles, filling only to the "shoulder" of each bottle.
Add one or two tablespoonfuls of dry yeast to each bottle and attach airlock.
(Mead is the ONLY fermented product it is not only safe, but often preferable
to use bread yeast to manufacture).  You may want to leave the bottles
"unlocked" for 12-24 hours to give the yeasty-beasties a headstart.  Leave in
warm, but not hot, place for 7-21 days, or until airlock "breaks."  Rack into
clean bottles.  You may top up with clean water, if you wish.  This lightens
the flavour and assists in the mellowing process.  DON'T use processed city
water!  Age in cool spot for AT LEAST six weeks -- it can safely go for a
year.  Rack once more when it looks clear, and be sure always to leave all the
GUCK in the bottom of the bottle whenever you rack.  ENJOY IN MODERATION --
NOTHING is as bad as a mead hangover!

Wylde-Rose-Petal Metheglyn

Use basic recipe as above, but reduce cloves to 5 or 6 large -- count 'em --
and add one whole nutmeg, split in half, and one or two one-pint ziploc
bagfuls of fresh (or frozen) rose petals.  Wild roses are the best for this,
as they are more fragrant; the red or pink have more flavour than the white.
When you pick, go for the newly opened or just opening flowers; take ONLY the
petals; pack 'em as tightly in the bags as you can.  They store well in the
freezer until use (but not overlong).  This recipe makes a smaller volume of
product than the basic, but the bouquet and flavour are unique and delightful
and the colour is GORGEOUS!

Melomel/Cyser

Use basic recipe, but eliminate allspice, scant other spices, add a nodule of
fresh ginger root, peeled and cut in pieces; omit the tea; use a tad more
yeast; and REPLACE THE WATER WITH FRUIT OR BERRY JUICE.  It's unusual, but
"Gran' shtuff!"  When apple juice is used, it can be called cyser.  Make sure
juice is fresh and has NO preservatives or "spoilage retardants," 'cause it
won't ferment if it does.  Cyser or pear melomel are FANTASTIC when drunk warm
in the winter.  Glenn & Faith's Rose Petal Wine Pick 4-8 quarts rose petals
(firmly packed) 10 days to two weeks after last spraying and let cold water
run over them for ten minutes to wash off any residual gunk.  Bring two
gallons of water (the GOOD stuff) to a boil, put petals in a crock, and pour
the boiling water over them.  When it has cooled, squeeze the petals
thoroughly by hand to get all the scented liquid out.  Strain the result into
an enamel pot, squeezing out every drop of juice, add 6-8 pounds of sugar,
bring to SLOW boil, and brew for 20 minutes or so.  Pour back into CLEAN
crock, let cool to lukewarm, dissolve 1/2 ounce yeast in 1/2 cup warm water,
and add.  Cover.  (Air-lock should be applied at this point, if you have one.)
Let ferment 14-21 days.  Rack off.  Let stand until clear.  Re-rack and
bottle.  Age for AT LEAST a year.  SERVE COLD!

Rowanberry Wine (I FOUND IT!)

Gather berries when ripe and dry.  Pick clean from stalks and place in large
container (a plastic beer bucket is excellent).  Cover with boiling water and
let stand 4-5 days, muddling occasionally.  (It takes about 2 1/2 lbs.
berries per gallon of water.)  Strain off liquor, measure, and allow one pound
sugar per gallon.  Put sugar in large vessel, pour in liquor, stir until
dissolved, add one ounce crushed fresh ginger root, and leave to ferment 10-12
days (or longer if still actively working).  NB: You may add yeast and/or
nutrient if you're more interested in success than in tradition.  Close
tightly and allow to age 6 months before bottling.  Store in cool, dry place.
NB: Rowan, called "dogberry" in some places, and "rountree" in others, is
actually the European mountain ash.  Native North American mountain ash will
work, but not as well.  The product is fairly astringent, but good, and the
colour is lovely.  Now, who's going to get back to me with the elderblow
recipe??  You have all my secrets that I can send in the mail.

Toast (Spanish):
Bendito sea el arbol
De donde sacaron la madera
De que hicieron el cabo del martillo
Con que clavaron la pila
En que te bautizaron.

>Blessed be the tree
>From which they took the wood
>From which they made the handle of the hammer
>That nailed the nails into the font
>Where you were baptized.

This is to be said in one breath and one's glass must be emptied before one is
allowed to inhale again.

SIMA
Lemon-flavored Mead (Finnish)

To make 5 quarts

2 large lemons
1/2 cup granualated sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
5 quarts boiling water
1/8 teaspoon yeast
5 tsp. sugar
15 raisins

With a small, sharp knife or rotary peeler, carefully peel off the yellow
skins of the lemons and set them aside.  Then cut away the white membranes of
the lemons and discard them.  Slice the lemons very thinly.  In a 6 to
8-quart enameled or stainless-steel bowl, combine the lemon slices, lemon
skins and the two sugars.  Pour the boiling water over the fruit and sugar,
stir, and let the mixture cool to tepid.  Then stir in the yeast.  Allow the
Sima to ferment, uncovered at room temperature for about 12 hours.  To
bottle, use 5 one-quart bottles with very tight covers or corks.  Place 2
teaspoon of sugar and 3 raisins in the bottom of each bottle.  Strain the
Sima through a sieve and, using a funnel, pour the liquid into the bottles. 
Close the bottles tightly and let them stand at room temperature for 1 or 2
days until the raisins have risen to the surface.  Chill the sealed bottles
until ready to serve.

I hope this is what you were looking for.

Ralf,

Things about Mead.

The less honey, the lighter the drink, and the quicker it can be made.
1 pound of honey per gallon of water is the minimum, 5 pounds per gallon is
the maximum for a sweet dessert wine.  If you add dark berries to the
mead mixture it will tend to mature earlier.  Some say that it takes at least
1 year for a mead to age properly and others say 4-5 years.  I have found
that 6 months to 1 years is a good period.  There are several books out there
that talk about making mead.   I do not recall the exact title but any
local homebrew shop should have them.

If you want more just post on the homebrew group.

Relax have a homebrew.

Recipe:  Mead - "Same As It Every Was"

3 gallons water
5 pound honey
2 teaspoons yeast nutient
1 ounce hops (Cascades)
1 package yeast (champagne, wine or ale)

In pot boil honey, water, nutients and hops for 30 minutes.  Let cool to
about 100F and then add yeast starter.  I usually find it easier to mix
the yeast with warm water and then pour into the container.  Let mixure sit
for 7 days and then transfer the liquid to another container.  Allow this
to sit for 1-2 months covered and at room tempeture.  Rack to your choice
of containers.

If you are not famiar with the brewing process you should try to pick up
some books on it before you start with.

Mead Recipes

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
>From bemo@spacsun.rice.edu Thu Aug  8 16:40:01 1991

     The following is based upon my own experiences in brewing, and information
that I have gleaned from various publications on wine and beer-making.  First, I
will deal with 'long' meads, and then quicker 'short' meads for the impatient
at heart.

     Mead is really not that difficult to make.  I am hardly a wizened master
(having only 6 gallons of production under my belt, so to speak), but I will
venture to state that anyone patient and clean enough by nature can make quite
a nice brew at home.
    First, let me say that it is much easier to do if you have a homebrew supply
store in town.  It is possible to get everything you need mail order, but
nothing tops the convenience and inspirational value of actually browsing in a
store.  All that you would need to get from there is the yeast and airlocks;
anything else could be found or substituted from other sources.
     So let's get to basics.  Get lots of honey, preferably clover honey
(try your local 'health food' store; mine has bulk honey for 1.19/lb., although
it is not clover).  Use from 2-4 pounds per U.S. gallon of water, depending on
your desired sweetness and alcohol level.  3 pounds should get you a slightly
sweet white wine-ish mead.
     Boil the honey in the water, skimming off the grayish-brown foam which
will form on top, until the foam is no longer formed at a rapid rate (I usually
wait until it takes about 2 minutes to form enough foam to skim effectively.)
     Now you need to add some fruit; for 2 gallons, I usually add a lime and an
orange, with about 1 oz. of ginger to boot.  You can use any citrus you like,
in almost any amount you like.  The purpose of this, besides taste, is to
balance the wine; it also prevents oxidation later on.  Cut it up, throw it in,
but remember to minimize the amount of white pith that goes into the pot, as
it adds an unpleasantly bitter taste to the wine.  I usually grate some peel
into the pot, then squeeze in the juice, with some pulp thrown in as well.
Peel the ginger, cut it up, throw it in; grating will utilize more of the
ginger, but makes it harder to strain out.  Also, nothing beats the zingy taste
of ginger boiled in honey water!  What the hell, eat the fruit too, it's good 
for you.
     OK, so you have some hot pre-mead, now what?  Let it cool, preferably
covered, until you can handle it reasonably well.  Now you need a narrow-necked
container, preferably glass.  I use 1-gallon apple juice jugs.  There are also
large plastic tubs, with a tight-fitting lid that has a small hole drilled in it
for the airlock, which works equally as well.  These are available at homebrew
shops as well, and are especially helpful for those big batches.
   The key to preventing any unwanted contamination of your mead is cleanliness.
Clean and sterilize your container, with either sodium metabisulphite (also at
HBrew shops) or with a bleach solution (no more than two tablespoons per gallon
of water).  Chlorine bleach will kill the nasty organisms, but requires a lot of
hot water rinses of the container afterwards.  Sodium metabisulfites are the
sulfites in commercial wines, but they only inhibit growth, and can also cause
allergic reactions.  So if you can't drink commercial wines without a reaction
(except, of course, that pleasant drunk feeling), go with the bleach.  One could
also attempt to use heat to sterilize the equipment (say, the heat-dry cycle of 
a dishwasher), but personally I do not recommend this,as it canhave a disastrous
effect on the glass (and anything in range if it breaks apart).
    Once it is sterilized and well-rinsed, fill your container with cooled mead.
Try to strain it as you fill; bits of fruit pulp and peel should not be allowed
to remain while fermenting, as it may start to decay and spoil all your effort.
Cover and alloe to cool to room temperature.  Meanwhile, prepare your airlock,
sterilizing it as you did the container.  Fill it halfway with either water or
sulfite solution at the appropriate strength (check the package), and definitely
NOT with bleach solution.  Removing the airlock or pressure changes may suck
some of the solution into the mead, and the bleach would make it undrinkable.
Sulfite solution is preferred (since water could be infected by the dreaded
vinegar fly), and it won't poison the product.
     When the mead is fully cooled, you can now add the yeast.  It is considered
best to take a little of the mead in a beer bottle, add the yeast packet, and
let it start off to the side before adding it to the entire batch; this becomes
really necessary if your batch is in several jugs, instead of just one.  Also,
it is very important to use a yeast nutrient, which should be right next to the
yeast when you buy it.  You will need about 1 teaspoon per gallon, since honey
is extremely deficient in the chemicals necessary for yeast to reproduce.
     The choice of yeast could be important; most meadmakers steer clear of ale
yeasts, since they have a low alcohol tolerance (9%?)  and reportedly impart
an unwanted flavor to the mead.  I myself have used ale yeasts, with no
undesirable effects. Preferably, one should use a mead yeast, but if not, a wine
or Champagne yeast work just as well.
     Now you just add the yeast and nutrient, and fit the airlock over the mouth
of your container (a variety of sizes of rubber stoppers are available, so don't
be concerned with whether ornot your bottle is the 'right' size for the airlock.
Be sure to test your stopper first, to see if it will hold the seal).  Put it
in a corner somewhere, and watch it go.
     I have had experiences where the fermentation was so violent that mead foam
was forced through the airlock. It is not that large of a concern; just clean it
up every once in a while,fill the airlock again(see why you don't want bleach!),
and reseal the container.This is another reason to strain the mixture; you don't
want to block the airlock, or your meadmaking could soon become an experiment in
bomb making!  Check on it ever once in a while, to make sure the carbon dioxide
is escaping.  It will soon calm down, and the soft, steady bloop sounds which
brewers all cherish from their airlocks will soon sing you to sleep.
     The hardest part is now upon us -- waiting.  Mead takes excrutiatingly long
to ferment, since the sugars in it are so complex.  This is when it is handy to
have a hydrometer, which is just a cheap device to measure the specific gravity
(and hence the sugar content) of your brew.  If you have one, read the enclosed
instructions;if not, don't worry about it. You will just have to be more patient
and observant is all.  Watch your mead; a layer of yeast will fall to the bottom
of your container (so clear glass is preferable). When the layer is substantial,
you will want to siphon the mead into another container, so that the dead yeast
there will not break down and spoil the mead. This will take on the order of two
to three months, and then again in another two to three months.  After these two
transfers (called 'racking'), the mead should be 'clear'; if it is cloudy, the
yeast haven't finished yet, so let it sit some more.  If the mead is clear but
bubbles are still visible, the yeast haven't finished yet.  If no deposit forms,
it is clear, and no bubbles are visible, then the yeast are probably through,
and you can bottle.
     Sterilize the bottles that you plan to use as you did the other equipment.
Since mead sometimes fools you into believing it is done, Champagne bottles are
preferable.  If any bottle fermentation does take place, you do not want it in
regular bottles, or without the cork wired down.  If you wish, regular bottles
can be used, but be sure to use a wine stabilizer,and only after fermentation is
complete. Until you are experienced, better safe than sorry (and messy).  Siphon
your mead into the bottles and cork.  Plastic corks are just fine to use, and
are reusable.  Cages are also reusable, to a point, if you have trouble getting
new ones.  If you've done it all right, no sediment should form, and you should
have a fine still mead.  If not, bottle fermentation has taken place, you have a
little sediment around the punt of your Champagne bottle, and you have fine
sparkling mead (or else you've cleaned up your winerack, if you used a regular
bottle).  Age as long as you can stand, up to two years, but open one fairly
early, as reward and to check for bottle fermentation.
     To intentionally make sparkling mead, you need to have made a low-alcohol
batch (I'd say <= 2.5 lb/gallon), and you really should buy a hydrometer to tell
you when it is finished.  In this case you must use a high-alcohol wine yeast;
ale yeast will not work.  When it is, remove a small portion of mead, boil it,
and add some sugar to the boiling mead, cover and cool, and add back to the
batch.  I do not have the reference that I want nearby, but for beer the amount
is 4 oz. per gallon, so that should be about right.  Less is OK, more is not
recommended.  Then bottle in Champagne bottles (or beer bottles -- Grolsch
bottles are very good for this, and replacement seals are available). Wait a few
weeks (longer if honey was used), chill, and pour the mead carefully off of the
sediment (you Chimay ale drinkers know what I mean).  This is why you may want
to use less sugar in the bottle than 4 oz; the bubbles released when opening can
force the sediment off of the bottom of the bottle and into your glass, so fizzy
mead becomes fizzy yeasty mead, which can be comestibly and gastrically
unpleasant.
    Once you have a few batches under your belt, you can add fruit, hops, more
ginger, whatever you think would taste good. Amounts are generally a pound or so
of fruit, an ounce or so of hops, per gallon.  Experimentation, though sometimes
yielding unfortunate results, is the key to getting what you want.  However, if
fruit is to be used, do not boil it (it may jellify), and if you can, sterilize
it with sulfites and add pectic enzyme to the brew.  Crush it, add it, and make
sure that it does not clog the airlock.If you use hops, I suggest a mild variety
like Fuggles or Cascade.  More bitter hops could be used, but I would relegate
them only to the quick sparkling meads,where the beer quality is more pronounced
and less invasive than in wines.

     Now that you have made a long mead, you'll need to make a quick mead to
drink while you wait. Use about 2-2.5 lbs of honey per gallon; any more, and the
yeast may take to long, depriving you of the relatively quick satisfaction you
seek.  Also, I suggest using an ale yeast, despite all convention.  After all,
you are essentially making honey beer here, not wine, which by its very nature
needs to be delicate and well-aged.  Do that mead thing just like before.  Allow
vigorous fermentation to run its course.  In ten to twenty days, the mead should
have settled down.  Ale yeast is a top-fermenting yeast, so it works best in a
warm environment.  Because we want to arrest fermentation, we need to cool it.
Find a place in your fridge where the bottle can stand up with the airlock init,
and stick it there.  The yeast will slow down and sink, and thus the mead will
start to clear.  When it is clear, bottle in either beer or Champagne bottles,
and leave it out for a day or two if you want it carbonated, then refrigerate.
If you wish, wait a little longer, then transfer it instead into a plastic
thermos, and drink it quickly.  If it's too yeasty, next time wait longer.
Wait a week for the sediment to form, then drink.  Do not wait too long; bottle
fermentation will soon make the mead gush out of the bottle when opened, mixing
the yeast back in the mead.  If this starts to occur, you must rebottle or face
the consequences.  The longer you can wait until bottling, the more unlikely
that you end up with little mead time bombs in your fridge.  This is the other
reason for using ale yeast; its low alcohol tolerance will end fermentation
earlier than wine yeast, lowering the danger limit to your bottles (and you).
As anecdotal evidence, I relate the story of my ginger beer, which when opened,
put a plastic Champagne cork imprint on my ceiling, followed by the entire
contents of the bottle, which then proceeded to ginger-bathe my entire kitchen.
(By the way, the kitchen smelled great).  I then had to go in the back yard and
defuse the remaining four bottles, hitting the back fence three out of four
shots.  Sparkling mead demands respect, and usually gets it from whomever it
wishes.  Aged sparkling mead is sparkling mead with an attitude.  Really old
sparkling mead doesn't kill people, people kill people.  I know people who
would rather rip their own heads off than open a bottle of really old sparkling
mead.
    After several batches of quick mead, it will become apparent what variations
to try, and which of these you wish to try with your long meads.  Once again, I
stress the virtues of experimentation, especially with these quick meads, in
which you have invested a lot less waiting and bother, and hence won't be so
disappointed if something goes awry.  The best laid plans o' mice and mead...

     While this discussion is by no means a definitive guide on meads, I feel
that it should clear up some misconceptions on the subject, some of which have
been propogated through folios and articles within the SCA itself, including the
first Knowne World Handbooke, which I feel really shows it age in this topic.
The technology and literature on the subject of homebrewing has increased
severalfold since its penning, and it would be folly to discount it only on
the basis of period accuracy and perceived complexity.  Become the life of the
barony, and earn the respect of your heavy fighters.  Kiss up to the king,
and bring your wares to the war.  Everybody loves a brewer!

Sure. From "First Steps in Winemaking", by Charles J. J. Berry:

Ingredients:
4 lb honey      1 orange        1 lemon         1 nutrient tablet
pectic enzyme   yeast           1 gallon water

(Makes one gallon)

Put the honey in the water and bring to a boil. (I understand that
many people disagree, and only bring it to about 165F.) Pour into
your primary fermentation vessel and allow to cool. Add the juice
from the lemon and orange, yeast, and nutrient. Fit an airlock
and allow to ferment to completion--this is liable to take much 
longer than most country wines (as he calls them)--and rack when
no further bubbles are passing thru the airlock. (If you can
stand to...) mead should be matured for a year.

I've made three batches of mead, using this basic recipe. For your
primary fermentation, go straight into a carboy. One batch of mine
was so vigorous it bubbled out thru the airlock, something I've
only had happen one other time. I experimented with more honey
in my second batch, and results were not good; oversweet. If you
know a beekeeper, you need about 1 gallon of honey to make 5 gallons
of mead. It's possible to substitute a tablespoon or so of citric
acid for the lemon and orange juice, or use frozen concentrate.

The mead I made was popular, and I've another gallon of honey 
ready for the next batch....

Well, it's one of those things that's made in many variations over a
common base, by adding small amounts of spices or flavorings.

Briefly, to make a 5 gallon batch of plain mead, start with one 
gallon of honey (about 10-12lb, I think--my suppliers just use 1 gal
syrup jugs). Pour about a quart into a pot with about a half-gallon
of water, and heat until it's warm enough to pasteurize it (I use 
raw honey from local beekeepers), say about 170F (77C). Some recipies
say boil it, some say don't ever... I've used both, but not closely
enough to pass judgement. The two batches in the kitchen now were
not boiled. I covered the pot and turned off the heat, to let it
sit for a few minutes at temperature. Note that you should be stirring
almost constantly to dissolve the honey, and keep it from scorching
(this is the only real pain about mead making, very simple otherwise).
Allow it to cool to about room temp (I pour it into another pot in the
sink, with cold water running around it. Cover the pot to keep the
mix from being contaminated by airborne dust, yeasts, or bacteria.).
When cool, pour into your primary fermentation vessel (I use a 5 gal
glass carboy), and repeat with all the honey (the objective is to not
end up with not more than 4.5 gallons of the honey-water mixture, you
should add water to this level--but NOT to the 5 gal mark, yet!).
Add 5 winemaking nutrient tablets, or juice from one lemon, and yeast.
Some people use Champagne yeast; some use other wine yeast; strange
people like me use Fleishmanns' Rapid-Rise. Your choice; you'll get
higher attenuation with the Champagne yeast, at $1 or so a pack, the
Rapid-Rise is cheaper, and works OK for me. (To the brewers/vintners
out there: I've been flamed already; it didn't make me change. Don't
bother....:-) )

Put an airlock-and-stopper assembly (about $2.50 total, here) in the
carboy. Fermentation should be noticable within 6-8 hours, and roaring
in 24. It takes about 10 days for primary fermentation to finish (this
is the most vigorous stage), which you can determine by the 1.5-2"
layer of sediment on the bottom and a marked reduction in activity
(one glub per minute thru the airlock, instead of twelve per minute).
I siphon the clear liquid (looks like tea in color, darkness varies
depending upon the honey) into another carboy, add water to the
5 gallon level, install the airlock, and let it proceed thru 
secondary fermentation. This will be at least 2 weeks, and can be
allowed to run for months, if you're not in a hurry. If you get
a lot more sediment, siphon it again (this is called "racking" or
"racking off" in the winemaking world). My secondaries seem to 
throw less than 1/2" of sediment.

When it's done (or you can't wait any longer) add 5 Campden tablets
(75/$2.50) to kill off the last of the yeast (unless you're trying
to make sparkling mead, in which case you should know what you're
doing). Give them a day to work, then bottle. I've started using 
16oz soft drink bottles, since they're cheap and convenient. I start
drinking mine at this point, you may want to age it for a while.

That's basic mead. My current two batches are spiced, with a little
cinnamon and nutmeg (in one, boiled in one batch of mix, in the other
just tossed into the primary), to see how they'll come out. Other
spices can be used to your taste; fruit can be added (cherry and
blueberries that I've heard of, I may try blackberries next time)
and it becomes a melomel instead of just mead. There are at least
as many variations as there are people making it. Smaller batches
are possible, of course; 5 gallons are convenient for me. My sources
want $10 for a gallon of honey; beyond that, nutrients and Campden
tablets add perhaps another $.50 or so, to yield about $2.10/gallon
material cost. It takes me about an hour to start a batch, and
10 minutes or so each time to rack it. You end up with an interesting
beverage, somewhat stronger than beer, at about $.20/12oz serving.

Normal brewing/vintning sanitary proceedures apply, of course,
but that's another message about this size that you can read in
any wine/beer making book. 

If anyone has any specific questions, I'll be glad to help--I've
found this to be an interesting hobby, producing something I can
use :-) without requiring large investments in equipment (if you
find carboys at flea markets, you can get started for as little
as $20, depending on their cost), huge amounts of space (I do this
in my kitchen, which isn't very large), or lots of effort.

Enjoy!

Don't know about authenticity, but here's one from my undergraduate
microbiology lab manual-- the mead was well received by class members,
in contrast to the wine and beer we made...

1/4 orange
1/4 lemon
1/2 lb honey
nutrient solution*
1 500 ml flask with air trap to fit flask**
Yeast starter culture: Maury yeast or all-purpose wine yeast
1 hydrometer

Add honey to 250 ml water and bring the solution to a boil, stirring
constantly to prevent carmelization.  Allow the solution to cool, adding
juice from orange and lemon quarters, then yeast and nutrient solution.
Adjust specific gravity of solution to 1.093 (12-13% potential alcohol).
Place solution in flask and add air lock.  Ferment until no more CO2
is evolved.  Rack mead into another container when completed.


*nutrient solution: 4 gm (NH4)2SO4 + 0.5 gm MgSO4 + 2 g KH2PO4 dissolved
in minimal water.  Use the entire quantity for 1000 ml mead; use proper
proportion for other amounts. 

**the air trap is just a rubber stopper with a piece of plastic or
glass tubing bent down to fit into a container of water.

A couple of people emailed me requests for the recipe I use for light 
meads, so I thought it might be worth posting.  Actually, it's not mine, 
it's Kenelm Digby's; but his copyright expired a while back...  ;^}.

And here it is:

Take nine pints of warm fountain water, and dissolve in it one pint of
pure White-honey, by laving it therein, till it be dissolved.  Then boil
it gently, skimming if all the while, till all the scum be perfectly
scummed off; and after that boil it a little longer, peradventure a 
quarter of an hour.  In all it will require two or three hours boiling,
so that at last one third part may be consumed.  About a quarter of an
hour before you cease boiling, and take it from the fire, put to it a
little spoonful of cleansed and sliced Ginger; and almost half as much 
of the thin yellow rind of Orange, when you are even ready to take it from 
the fire, so as the Orange boil only once warm in it.  Then pour it into
a well-glassed strong deep great Gally-pot, and let it stand so, till it
be almost cold, that it be scarce Luke-warm.  Then put to it a little
silver-spoonful of pure Ale-yeast, and work it together with a Ladle to
make it ferment: as soon as it beginneth to do so, cover it close with a
fit cover, and put a thick dubbled woolen cloth about it.  Cast all things
so that this may be done when you are going to bed.  Next morning when you
rise, you will find the barm gathered all together in the middle; scum it 
clean off with a silver-spoon and a feather, and bottle up the Liquor, 
stopping it very close.  It will be ready to drink in two or three days,
but it will keep well a month or two.  It will be from the first very quick
and pleasant.

*****

Notes:

(1) I have gone anywhere from 9/1 water/honey to 11/1, depending on the 
desired strength.

(2) I generally let it go more like 3-4 days than 2-3; at the end of that
time, I refrigerate it.

(3) If you are _really_ thorough in the skimming, you really _don't_ get
any significant scuz in your mead, and it doesn't need any other racking.

(4) Notice that apart from a teaspoon of sliced fresh ginger (_not_ ground
dried) and a few slivers of the outermost peel of orange, there are no
spices or flavorings.  This is a very good mead to use to discover what kinds
of honey and yeast you like best, since there are few confounding flavors.

(5) This stuff was never exposed to oak casks, so there is no need for 
anything to make tannin.

(6) This stuff was simply let set a few days in a big glassed container, then
bottled (using 17th century bottling methods).  You don't need fancy equipment
of any sort.

(7) DON'T USE BREAD YEAST!  -- But I think I've mentioned that.... ;^}

rec.brewing will have many more than these, but let me try to stick
to the historic angle.

Digby's recipe book, gives a number of historical mead, metheglin (spiced
mead and honey) and melomel (fruit juice and honey) recipes.  If you read
all of them, you can even find a certain amount of technique.  The major
difference between making mead then, and now, is our knowledge of cleanliness,
yeast culture, and a burning desire for consistency that we can satisfy.

Given my own peculiar combination of desires (I am a member of the Society
for Creative Anachronism), I am willing to use modern notions of cleanliness,
but not modern ingredients nor techniques.  Since mead is nothing but
honey and water, and was usually aged in oak barrels, here is a cobbled
together recipe that will work reasonably well.

approx 3 pounds of honey (aka 1 quart) (from Digby)
1 gallon of water
1 Tablespoon of Oak Bark (my idea of how to fake oak aging.)
  (My local health food store sells it in bulk, as White Oak Bark.)
Yeast (I always use champagne yeast)

tools:
  Large pot, wooden or plastic spoon, cheese cloth, funnel, bottles,
  siphoning tube, some method of capping bottles (corks, champagne corks,
  or bottle caps and a capper), string. Labels for the bottles, fermenting
  container (I use one gallon cranberry juice bottles.)  Cork and fermention
  lock.

The rest is technique.  Wrap the oak bark in cheesecloth, and tie it shut.
Put one gallon of water in a pot.  Stainless steel or enamel or glass.
Aluminum is not historical, and taints the flavor.  Cast Iron is historical,
and ruins the flavor (:-).  Use an inert spoon to stir with, too. I
use wood. Throw in the oak bark.

Digby suggests that you use the following method.  Measure the level of
the water with your spoon.  Add the honey, and boil until the level returns
to one gallon.  I like this technique, and always use it.  However, I add
the honey after the water is hot or boiling, since it mixes better.

For the new brewer, don't just dump in the honey, since it will sink to
the bottom of the pot, and burn.  Mix it in well.  I use very high quality
honey, that costs a fortune.  The brewer in my area with a better reputation
uses generic store brand.  (Hi Michael) Use what makes you happy. (:-)

As you wait for the water to return to the lower level, skim off all foam
and gunk, and throw it away.  The more of this bitter gunk you chuck, the
better the mead will taste.  Some folks swear to never let your honey-water
mixture boil, others always do.  Pick your method.

When done, throw away the oak bark, and let the liquid (must) cool.  Put
it in a sterile one gallon container. I sterilize with Bee Brite (an
oxygenating bleach).  You can also use a super-weak bleach solution. In
either case, rinse very well.  When the liquid is cool enough that you can
leave your hand in contact with the outside of the container it is in,
pour it (through a sterilized funnel) into the container.  Add yeast.

I use champagne yeast.  It seems to be more robust in the face of missing
nutrients than other yeasts, produces more quickly, and has a nice flavor
and a high alcohol content.  I have used other yeasts, and never had
problems (although actual mead yeast can take a week or more to start up).

Put a sterile fermentation lock on the container, and wait.  Bottle when
the bubbling slows to one every 5 seconds or so.  Using a hydrometer to
measure the alcohol content is very useful, but I never have (neither did
Digby).

I rack (siphon the good mead at the top off, leaving nasty dregs behind)
at least once during the fermentation, and usually again when I bottle.
It's just easier to have a bottle with no gluck in the bottom to pour
out of when I bottle.

One gallon makes about 10 beer bottles worth, or a little more than four
champagne bottles worth.  You can spice mead (metheglin) with all sorts
of things.  I've used (in various combinations) oranges, lemons, rosemary,
lovage, nutmeg, mace, cloves, ginger, peppermint, cinnamon, and other
assorted things. I've tasted rose mead, and it's very nice.  We can talk
about other things when I have a bit more time...

Advise, or comments from other brewers, cooks or would-be brewers and cooks
are strongly encouraged.  Hints on fruit meads are nice too.  I've got
a handout on fruit meads on line, and would post it at the slightest
provocation.  I've recently made a terrible peach mead, and would love
to find out if it was the peaches or me, for example.  (One batch doesn't
prove much).

Julie Kangas asked me to post my fruit mead recipe.  Here it is.
I feel a little guilty, since it is mostly a technique born of
necessity, rather than research.  I don't do anything that couldn't
have been done historically, but that in no way proves that it *was*
done that way.  This has worked for me with both raspberries (which
was awsome), and strawberries (good, but I would have liked it better
if I bottled it sooner).

-------------
This recipe does not bother to teach basic mead-making technique.

This recipe produces a fine, clean fruit flavored mead, with a good
sweetness, and minimal interference.  It can be drunk within one week
of bottling, and does not keep more than 3 months.

  2 quarts of water
  3 lbs Honey
  1 Tbs White Oak Bark
  1 package Champagne Yeast.
  3 cups of clean fruit (ie 3 half pints of raspberries)

  Cheesecloth for spice bag and straining
  String for tieing spice bag.

Boil 2 quarts of water, with the oak bark in a spice bag.

While the water and spices reach the boiling point, clean the fruit,
slice it, and crush it with a fork. Save all the juice. Make sure the
fruit can fit through the neck of the funnel you will be using.

Add the honey when the water is boiling, and skim and reduce to original
2 quart level. Once the must is finished, turn off the heat, remove the
spice bag, add the fruit, and cover.  Let the temperature reduce to 150
degrees (takes about 45 minutes in my enamel and steel pot).  Add the
whole thing to your primary fermenter.

Do not top off with water! The carbonation will force the fruit to the
top of the fermenter.  If there is no room for the fruit to float out
of the must, it will plug the fermentation lock, and spill onto the
counter.

Leave the fruit in for about a week, or until the fermentation slows
substantially.  Boil some fresh water, and let it cool until it can
be added to the yeast without killing it.  Transfer the must to a
secondary fermenter, straining through a doubled cheesecloth to
catch the fruit.  I like to squeeze the leftover juice from the
fruit, too.  Top off with the cooled clean water to a normal level.

I rack it twice more. The first time I rack, I added more water. Let
it run until still, and then rack again.  Bottle into about 12 beer
bottles or 8 Grolsch bottles.  Serve cold after 1 week.

If you want a fizzy mead, as I did, you need to be aware that there are
two basic reasons why mead stops bubbling.  Mead stops fermenting when the
sugar is gone, or the alcohol level has topped out. If you want a
bubbly fruit mead, taste the mead before bottling.  If it is still
sweet but very alcoholic, add a little water before bottling, to
restart fermentation in the bottle.  If the mead is dry, add a little
sugar (No more than 2 teaspoons per gallon) to the entire gallon before
bottling. It all will depend on the sweetness of the fruit. With three
pounds of honey, it is quite possible you will hit both endpoints at
the same time.

You can make a sweet mead or a more dry mead - it's totally up to you.

There are several books which contain recipes for meads which usually turn
out good.  Here is a recipe I got from the net. It should turn out pretty good.


             FireHouse GingerMead
            ----------------------

Makes 5 Gallons.

===========
1/4 tsp		Irish Moss	Clarifying Agent
3/4 cups	Corn Sugar for bottling
1 1/2 lbs	Corn Sugar
7 1/2 lbs		Wildflower Honey
2 tsp		Gypsum (CaSO4 - Calcium Sulphate)
1/2 tsp		Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C Crystals) to prevent oxydation
4 oz		Freshly-grated supermarket ginger root
3 tsp		Yeast Nutrient
1 pkg		Champagne Yeast (redstar)
1 tsp		Liqued Smoke

Add everything except Yeast Nutrient & Yeast to water in Brew kettle to make
4 Gal.  Bring to boil and boil for 15 minutes, skimming off albumin proteins
as they form on the surface.  Cool and sparge (strain) to 5 gal. carboy. Sparge
with hot water (sparge through strainer filled with used ginger) to make 5 gals.
Add Yeast Nutrient and Yeast to carboy.

     Many people after cleaning their grass throw away the seeds,
stems, and twigs.  I would highly recommend that you save these, as
there are many recipes for these odds and ends.  A tasty hot drink
that resembles tea can be made very simply by tying up all the
waste from your stash into a muslin ball or a piece of cheesecloth.

Use the quantity you have on hand, as the quantity will determine
the strength and potency. Now, drop the cheesecloth containing the
grass into a kettle of water, and bring the water to a boil.  Allow
the kettle to boil for a few minutes, and then remove it from the
flame and let it steep for another five minutes with the grass
still inside.  After this, the drink is ready.  Just add sugar and
lemon to taste.
     If you decide against growing pot, and want to eat your seeds,
there is an interesting recipe for "seed pancakes".  It is prepared
by lightly toasting a quarter cup of seeds in a large frying pan. 
Now, take the seeds from the frying pan and add them to a mixture
of one cup of pancake mix, one egg, a quarter cup of milk, and one
tablespoon of butter.  Beat this mixture until it is smooth and
creamy.  Heat a frying pan with a small amount of butter, then pour
in pancake batter.  Turn the pancakes as they start to look done,
or when the edges begin to turn brown.  Repeat procedure until all
batter is used.  Serve pancakes with butter, maple syrup, and
honey.
     For a stimulating drink (sounds like all the rest of the
cookbooks) place eight ounces milk, a few spoonfuls of sugar, a
tablespoon of malted milk, half a banana, and half a tablespoon
grass, and three betel muts in a blender.  Keep the blender working
full speed for a few minutes, then strain and serve.
     If you like candy, it's very simple to make some using pot. 
Take a quarter cup of powdered grass and add water until it equals
a full cup.  Mix this with four cups sugar and two and a half cups
corn syrup.  Now heat in a large pot to 310 degrees, and add red
food coloring and mint flavoring.  Remove the pot from the stove,
and allow the mixture to cool a little, before pouring it onto wax
paper.  When the candy's cool, cut it into squares and eat.
     One of the most common recipes for cooking with pot is
spaghetti.  This recipe doesn't take too much special preparation:
Just when you add your oregane, add at the same time a quarter cup
grass, and allow it to simmer with the sauce.  Be sure to use well
cleaned grass, unless you can get into eating twigs and stems. 
Another way of serving pot with spaghetti is to grind it up very
fine and mix it with some ground cheese.  Then sprinkle the cheese-
pot mixture over the sauce just before eating.
     Dessert is probably the most important stage of the meal,
since it will be the last thing your guests remember before they
pass out all over your table.  For an interesting dessert, grind a
quarter ounce of grass very finely, and add enough water so it
forms a paste.  Now separately dissolve one and a half cups sugar
into two cups milk.  Add to this your pot paste and one lemon rind
grated.  Beat in a half cup heavy cream, until the mixture is firm
and thick.  Now pour the mixture into ice cube trays and freeze. 
Just before you're ready to serve, rebeat the frozen mush until it
becomes light and fluffy.

 AFRICAN-SOUP(SPV)        USENET Cookbook        AFRICAN-SOUP(SPV)



 AFRICAN BEAN SOUP

      AFRICAN-SOUP - A Lenten soup with beans and peanuts

      This is a soup that we eat  during  Lent.  It  came  from  a
      Catholic leaflet that unfortunately I no longer have.

 INGREDIENTS (Serves 8)
      3 Tbsp    margarine
      2 cups    carrots thinly sliced
      12 cups   boiling water
      1 cup     black eye peas dry
      1 cup     navy beans dry
      1 cup     green pepper diced
      3 1/2 tsp salt
      1/8 tsp   crushed red pepper
      1 cup     salted peanuts chopped

      2 Tbsp    onion powder
      1 Tbsp    basil leaves crushed
      1 1/2 tsp ground coriander

 PROCEDURE
           (1)  Melt margarine in large stock pot.   Add  carrots.
                Cook for 5 minutes.

           (2)  Add water, black  eyed  peas,  navy  beans,  green
                pepper,  salt,  and  crushed  red pepper (add more
                water, if necessary, to cover).

           (3)  Cook, covered, until  ingredients  are  tender,  1
                1/2-2 hours.

           (4)  Add peanuts, onion powder,  basil,  and  coriander
                during last 10-15 minutes of cooking.

           (5)  Taste  to  correct  seasonings.   Soup  should  be
                thick.

 NOTES
      If you want more of a peanut flavor, add peanut butter  (any
      kind) to taste during step 4.  I use about 1/2 of a cup.

 RATING
      Difficulty: easy.  Time: 15  minutes  preparation,  2  hours
      cooking.  Precision: no need to measure.

 ALU PIAJER CHORCHORI ( dry curried potato and onion )


 Ingredients ( to serve 4-6 )
 5 medium sized potatoes, cut in half lengthwise and the sliced into 1/8" pcs.
 crosswise.
 4 onions cut in half lengthwise and then sliced thicker than normal.
 2 tsp. turmeric paste.
 1/2 tsp. chili paste.
 4-6 green chilies washed and slit.
 Salt to taste.
 2 tbsp. oil.
 1/2 cup water or as required.

 Heat oil. When a blue haze appears, add potatoes and fry for several minutes
 until potatoes turn opaque. Reduce heat, add onions and continue to fry,
 stirring now and then for a couple of minutes more.

 Add the turmeric, chili paste and salt to taste, mixing thoroughly and keep
 frying. Add green chilies.

 The potatoes and onions should cook as much as possible in their own juices,
 but if the curry gets too dry, test to see how much cooking the potatoes need
 and accordingly add water a little at a time.

 The cooked dish is dry and therefore adding of water should be judicious. The
 curry is done when the potatoes are cooked and there is practically no gravy.

 This curry can be reheated before serving, and is a good accompaniment with
 rice, luchis, or porota.

 And enjoy !! :-) !!

 Keywords: recipe vegan amandas tomato sauce


 I have excellent suggestions for tomato sauce, if anyone is interested.


 This method was created by me after several burning episodes:


 Ingredients:
 ============

 fresh Italian parsley- no stems if possible: about a handful
 fresh basil: about 2 handfuls
 fresh ground pepper: to taste
 extra vigin olive oil: enough to cover the bottom of the pan
 sugar (OPTIONAL): about 3 tablespoons
 onions: 1 or two small ones
 tomato puree: at least two large cans (judgement call)
 tomato paste: one small can in case you screw up
 salt (OPTIONAL): a little
 corn syrup: only idiots like R*gu do that!!
 garlic: 3 or 4 cloves, sliced very thin, so they melt away

 Slice onions and garlic (slice garlic any way you like, but thin is
 good).  Pour oil in bottom of pan.  Put heat on medium.  Brown onions-
 when almost done add garlic, and brown both of them.  add about 32 oz
 water, herbs, salt, pepper, sugar. It should be an ugly, watery
 greenish mixture. Let it cook for about two hours over medium heat and
 stir once in a while.

 Cooking the watery mixture ensures that the parsley gets thoroughly
 cooked, otherwise it tastes "grassy".

 Add puree and stir well. Cook for about an hour. If it is too watery,
 you can add the paste to thicken it.

 You can do variations on the above: add browned lamb, sausages, chopped
 STEAK (no burgers!!), chunky tomatoes, or this other stuf called
 "Caponata", which is an eggplant and celery and olive ensemble.

 Enjoy!!

 Subject: VEGAN: Apple Butter



 >   I'd like to find recipes for these three recipes.
 >   As to the apple butter; my sister would like to make it, but none
 >   of her cookbooks have it.  A recipe on how to make apple butter
 >   would be much appreciated.

 Here's a recipe for apple butter, as found in "Joy of Cooking"

    For best results use Jonathan, Winesap, Wealthy or other well-flavored
 cooking varieties.

 Wash, remove the stems, and quarter:
     4 lb. apples
 Cook slowly until soft in:
     2cups water, cider or cider vinegar
 Put fruit through a fine strainer.  Add to each cup of pulp:

     1/2 cup white or brown sugar
 Add:
     1 teaspoon cinnamon
    1/2 teaspoon cloves
    1/4 teaspoon allspice
        (Grated lemon rind and juice is optional)
  Cook the fruit butter over low heat, stirring constantly until the sugar
 is dissolved.  Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture
 sheets from a spoon.  You can also place a small quantity on a plate.  When
 no rim of liquid separates around the edge of the butter, it is done.  Pour
 into hot sterilized jars.

 Apple Crisp


 Ingredients:

 8-10 apples
 1 cup sugar
 ground cinnamon
 1 stick butter (8 oz.), softened
 1 cup brown sugar
 pinch of salt
 1 cup flour

 Directions:

 Peel, core, and slice the apples and spread them in a rectangular cake pan.
 They should come almost to the top.  Pour sugar over apples.  Sprinkle
 cinnamon over apples to taste.  In a mixing bowl, mix butter, brown sugar,
 salt, flour.  It should have a mealy consistency, like dry oatmeal lumps.

 Spread the mix over the apples.  Bake at 350 F for 1/2 hour or until the

 Assuming you know how to make a piecrust, real apple pie is very simple:

 1. Press the piecrust dough into a pie pan.

 2. Peel, core and cut baking apples (Jonathans?) into wedges/

 3. Toss with cinnamon, allspice and perhaps 2T-1/4c sugar and a bit of
 tapioca, cornstarch or flour for thickening;

 4. Fill the crust generously.

 5. Cover with piecrust and make zillions of holes with a fork
                      *or*
    Cut strips of pastry dough and *weave* a lattice top, as my mom does,
    or did, when she made them regularly.

 6. Bake in a medium oven until brown.

 re request by KISTLER@Waisman.Wisc.Edu (ROOM 325 PH. 263-1968)


 APPLESAUCE CAKE

 1/2 cup oil
 1.5 cups sugar
 1.5 cups unsweetened applesauce
 2 cups flour
 1/2 tsp salt

 1.5 tsp baking soda
 1 tsp cinnamon    OR   1/4 tsp ginger     OR     1/2 tsp allspice
                      + 1/8 tsp cloves          + 1/8 tsp nutmeg

 Mix oil and sugar well, add applesauce, and mix in the dry
 ingredients.  Beat until smooth.  Pour into an oiled and floured pan
 and bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes, slightly longer in a loaf
 pan.  This cake is even better the next day.

 Well, that's the recipe as it appears in The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook
 (more or less).  It's a typical Farm Cookbook cake recipe--no eggs, no
 dairy, but plenty of sugar.  Remarks:

 1.  The book specifies "white flour," but I had great
     results with whole wheat pastry.

 2.  The book says "8-inch cake pan or angel food cake pan," but an 8-inch
     pan is MUCH too small. As I recall, my 9-inch square pan nearly overflowed.

 3.  I don't remember which spice option I used.  I think I mixed cinnamon
     with one of the other two choices.

 4.  Nuts and raisins are good additions. Especially nuts sprinkled on top. YUM.

 Enjoy!

 This isn't a recipe. It is an interpretation of a demo a friend of mine
 did for me. Atole is gruel. This comes out about like thin malt-o-meal.
 You drink it.

 Incidentally, I would say that America has a love affair with vanilla.

 There is vanilla flavoring in just about everything remotely sweet. Now
 Mexico uses cinnamon alot. Even in the chocolate. And in Atole con
 Honholi (spelling uncertain my friend doesn't write stuff down).

 .5 C sesame seeds (honholi), toast in a pan til just turning golden
      grind in a blender until mealy, not floury
 4 C water or milk
 .5 C piloncillo (or dark brown sugar) or to taste. This is pretty sweet.
 .25 masa harina (more or less, depending on how thick you want it)
 1 tsp cinnamon

 Bring seame seeds, water(or milk) brown sugar and cinnamon to a boil.
 Sprinkle in masa harina (corn flour to you guys north of here)(thats
 *flour* not meal) and stir constantly. Add more flour if you want it

 thicker. Simmer for 5 minutes or so. Drink warm.

 The last time I made this I toasted the masa harina lightly. Gave it a
 little bit 'nuttier' flavor I think. And I prefer milk to water.

 Well, I wasn't going to respond because my info is so sketchy, but I

 We make one from an ultra-easy recipe in the "Light and Spicy" cookbook

 The only ingredients are ripe avocado, light italian dressing, and
 whole cumin seed.  I _think_ the ratio is one avocado to one-half cup

 In the Joy of Cooking you can find the following:

     Basic pasta

 2-1/2C white flour  2/3C water  1t olive oil

 In a bowl, mix dry ingredients and make a well.  Beat liquids and pour
 into well.  Mix dry ingredients until dough forms and as much of the
 flour as possible is mixed in.  Turn out on a floured board or table.
 Flour your hands and knead dough until smooth and elastic, dusting your
 hands as needed.

 Roll into a ball, warp with plastic wrap (or cover with a wet towel)
 and allow dough to rest 10 minutes.  Cut into four pieces and shape
 into desired pasta.  If dough gets sticky, lightly dust with flour.

 Green noodles:

 puree' approximately 1/4C fresh or frozen spinach with the oil and
 water in a blender.  Mix it with the eggs and beat together -obviously,
 if you're not using eggs, this just goes in as part of the amount of
 water you're using-.  Add as usual.

 Various other colorants may be used, instead of spinach:

 tomato paste
 puree'd tomatoes
 puree'd beets (drained, or substitute their liquid for water)
 puree'd cooked carrots

 1 cup ww pastry flour (we've found it works much better if half of this is

 Put it into a mixer with bread hooks or a food processor, and knead until

 BATI CHORCHORI ( dry mixed vegetables )

 Ingredients ( serves 4-6 )
 200gms cauliflower florets.

 100gms shelled green peas.
 2 potatoes, peeled and cubed.
 1 medium eggplant, cubed.
 1 horseradish, peeled and cubed.
 1/4 onion, minced.
 1 tsp. turmeric paste.
 1/2 tsp. chili paste.
 2 tsp. mustard paste.
 3-4 green chilies, slit.
 4-6 tbsp. mustard oil.
 Salt to taste.

 This curry gets its name from the brass vessel ( bati ) in which it is
 cooked, so that the ingredients fit snugly in the bowl leaving just a
 one inch gap at the top. As a substitute, an aluminum or brass bowl
 with a tight fitting lid may be used.

 After cutting up all the  veggies, wash them well and place them in the
 bowl.  Add the mined onion, the masala pastes, and the green chillies.
 Add the oil and mix well after adding salt. Cover the bowl with its lid.

 Stir the vegetables occasionally over a medium-low heat, so they cook
 in their own juices withot any addition of water. remove from heat when
 the veggies are quite cooked and blended flavourfully with the spices.

 Any combination of vegetables may be used in preparing Bati Chorchori.

 This chorchori is a good accompaniment with rice.

 Sure! Lots! When I grill, I like to grill my entire dinner on over the
 coals, everything from appetizers to dessert. Here are some of the

 things I've done:

 1. skewered vegetables. Let marinate in Italian dressing or equivalent
    over night to pick up flavor. Cherry Tomatoes, chunks of green
    peppers, sweet onions, mushrooms, cubes of tofu (they really pick up
    the flavor), etc.  Soak the wooden skewers overnight before using to
    slow down the rate at which they blacken.

 2. Just skewered mushrooms. I separate these out because they are so
    incredibly delicious grilled that I often make them alone. Be sure
    to marinate them in some kind of oil-based marinade, or they dry out
    and shrivel up. (Try a mixture of olive oil, fresh organo, and
    garlic.) Brush on more of this oil as they're cooking. Be careful
    not to overdo it because the oil causes flare ups.

 3. Eggplant. This is also marvelous. Don't bother to salt/drain it, or it
    tends to get too dry on the grill. I like to use the Japanese
    eggplant sliced quite thin on the diagonal, grill until they start
    to blacken, and then toss the slices in a dressing made of olive
    oil, balsamic vinegar, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic, dash of sugar,
    and dash of cayenne/red pepper flakes.

 4. Corn on the cob. Take off all the silk you can, then soak it in water
    in the husk. Put on the grill....yum.

 5. Baked potatoes. Since I hate to waste heat, I often wrap up a few

    potatoes in foil (wash first, and pierce skins) and set them over
    the coals as they're burning out. I don't know how long they really
    take, as I leave them overnight and they're done in the morning :-).
    The coals give a very interesting flavor to the potato.

    Something I've thought of to do at the next BBQ: wash and halve
    small red potatoes, then wrap them in foil with butter and onions
    and garlic. They should take a lot less time, and I'd imagine the
    flavors will blend well.

 6. Tofu and fish and onions. This is a favorite of a friend...marinate
    them all in soy sauce and onions and olive oil, then wrap in foil
    with the onions and toss on the grill. This was fantastic.

 Hi everyone!

 This is a vegan version of a recipe I lifted from "The Joy of Cooking".
 It sounds a tad yukky, but it is actually quite good. Also, the
 measurements are approximate, so one can adjust to their taste.

 Ingredients:

 1 can of beans (white northern or pinto are very good)
 1 onion (size depends on how much you like onions)
 1-2 cloves of garlic (I love garlic so I tend to use a lot.)

 1 medium sized apple
 1 orange
 2-3 tablespoons of honey

 2-4 tablespoons of maple syrup
 crushed nuts (almonds or cashews are good)
 cinnamon
 nutmeg
 rosemary
 white pepper

 Instructions:

 Put the beans in a small casserole dish or small bread-baking pan. Chop
 up the onions and spread them over the beans in the pan or dish. Do the
 same thing with the garlic, apple, and orange. Then, drizzle the honey
 then the syrup over the mixture. Mix the crushed nuts with the spices
 (use enough spices to suit your taste), and then drizzle the nut mixture
 over the beans and fruit. Bake at 300 degrees for 1-3 hours. Then put
 some on your plate and gobble it up!

 Hi there. This version came over the net a while
 ago and it's worked quite well for me...

 BLACK BEAN CHILI (makes about 12-15 cups)
    4 cups dried black beans
    2 large red bell peppers
    3 Tbs. cumin seed
    2-1/2 Tbs. dried oregano (leaf, not ground)
    1/2 cup olive oil
    2 large onions, finely chopped
    1-1/2 cups diced green bell pepper
    3 Tbs. minced garlic
    4-1/2 tsp. paprika
    1 tsp. cayenne pepper
    1 tsp. salt
    5 cups crushed tomatoes
    4 to 6 (or more!) fresh jalapenos, seeded and deveined, finely chopped

 Sort and rinse the beans, place them in a pot with ``enough'' water and
 soak them overnight.  Drain off water and rinse, add enough new water
 to cover by two inches and bring to a boil.  Simmer, covered, until
 beans are tender (about 1 hour), adding more water if necessary.  Drain

 beans, saving 3 cups of the liquid.  Return beans to pot with 1-1/2
 cups of the liquid.

 Roast the red bell pepper under the broiler until the skin is charred,

 then throw it into a paper bag and close the bag. Set it aside to cool.

 Heat oven to 325 degrees, put cumin seed and oregano in a small baking
 pan or casserole and roast until fragrant, shaking pan occasionally
 (about 10 minutes).

 Heat oil in skillet.  Saute onions, green pepper and garlic for 3
 minutes, then add cumin, oregano, paprika, cayenne and salt.  Cook about
 10 minutes more, then add tomatoes and jalapenos and bring to a boil for
 a couple of minutes.  Stir all this in with the beans.

 Get the red bell pepper out of the bag, peel the skin off, remove seeds
 etc.  (After peeling, if any parts look like they got badly burned, cut
 them away.) Chop and add to beans.

 Simmer everything for a while, thinning with the rest of the saved bean
 liquid as desired.

 Sanjiv Singh was looking for this, I haven't actually made it due to a
 chronic shortage of black beans in Edinburgh, but as soon as I find
 some ...

 This recipe comes from "Hot & Spicy" by Marlena Spieler, a great book!

 BLACK BEAN CHILI

 Ingredients :

 8oz(225g) black beans   900ml water
 700ml vegetarian soup stock  500ml tomato sauce (or chopped toms)
 2 tbsps olive oil   2 chopped onions
 5-8 cloves garlic (chopped)  1/2 sweet red pepper (diced)
 1/2 mild chilli    1 tbsp cumin
 2 tbsps mild chili powder  1 tbsp oregano
 1-2 tbsps salsa or hot pepper seasoning
 1oz (25g) chopped coriander leaves (cilantro)

 Method :

 1) Sort through the beans to remove any pebbles etc. Place in a large
 pot and add the water.  Soak overnight, or boil for 2 mins, remove
 from the heat, cover and let stand for an hour.

 2) Drain, then pour over fresh water to cover and bring to the boil.
 Reduce the heat and simmer for 1.5 hours, or until just tender. Add
 the stock and tomato sauce, then raise the heat and cook over a
 medium-high heat until the liquid reduces and thickens somewhat and
 the beans begin to fall apart into an ebony stew

 3) Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a frying pan and saute the onion,
 garlic and red pepper, mild chilli, spices and oregano until the onion
 is limp. Add to the beans with the salsa and continue to simmer for

 another 30-45 mins. If the mixture is too soupy at the end of cooking
 then raise the heat to high and boil off some of the liquid. Take care
 to stir the bottom every so often so that it does not burn.

 4) Serve hot, garnished with corainder/cilantro

 Happy cooking !

                 garlic cooked cabbage



  I love to play in the kitchen and invent new ways to use
 foodstuffs up, but I also like to find new foodstuffs to work with.
 Well, I went away to a Retreat at the end of last month and they serve
 vegetarian and macrobiotic fare.  This time my friend Russ was the
 co-cook with one other person and they made plain black beans, among
 some other dishes.  Well, I thought I'd try them and to make them more
 interesting I came up with this:

 Babs Woods    ca. Nov. 6, 1990

  Black beans and stuffed green olives

 1C dried black beans (Soaked 4hrs. in 4C water)

 1C chopped onion 2 cloves minced garlic
 1t chili powder  2 small bay leaves
 1C chopped celery 1C chopped carrots
 1/2t black pepper 4C water
 1/4C green olives, stuffed with pimientos (salad olives
  are fine), rinsed and drained (if desired)

  Combine drained soaked beans and everything but the olives in a
 pot.  Bring to a boil and hold there about 10-30 minutes, cover.
 Simmer about 2 hours.  Stir in the olives.  (Or stir in olives about 15
 minutes before serving.)

  This should not be soupy, nor should it be too gloppy.  Watch
 it carefully in the last 45 minutes of cooking (30 minutes before you
 add the olives).

 Serve with rice or corn and whatever you want.  Serve hot.  Serves
 about 4.


 This dish goes well in tortillas with salsa, cheese, veggies; much as
 you would fill a taco.  Serve rolled and filled tortillas on a bed of
 lettuce or cooked cabbage (below), topped with melted cheese, salsa,
 chopped tomatoes and anything else you want to add.

 Experiment.  Enjoy!

  ---------------------


   Cumin and garlic cooked cabbage

 3C shredded raw cabbage (red or green) (about)
 1t cumin seeds  1-2 cloves garlic
 2T oil   some hot water

  Heat the oil in a hot wok.  Slice the garlic and toss it in the
 oil about 5 seconds or so.  Add the cumin seeds, stir about 2 seconds.
 Throw in the cabbage, stirfry to coat well.  Stirfry about 2 minutes.
 Add about 3/4-1C hot water or so.  Cook until almost dry (it's
 important not to add too much water).  Serve hot.

 Keywords: recipe vegan/black-rice

 Someone recently requested a recipe for this; I got this one from a
 local newspaper.  You might be able to find the bai toey leaves in an
 oriental grocery store.  I've made this once, and it was very good.

 Black Rice with Coconut Milk

   2 cups glutinous black rice     1 cup sugar
   3 cups water       1/8 tsp salt
   1 can (13.5 oz) coconut milk     2 dried bai toey (pandanus) leaves


 Wash and drain the rice.  In a medium-sized pot, uncovered, bring the
 rice and water to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.  Reduce
 heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the rice is
 soft.  Let the rice cool.  In a saucepan, cook the coconut milk, sugar,
 salt, and bai toey leaves, uncovered, over low heat for 20 minutes,
 stirring occasionally.

 Discard the leaves.  Scoop spoonfuls of rice into individual serving
 dishes, then pour the coconut mixture on top.  Serve at room
 temperature.  If you do not eat all this dessert at one meal, you can
 refrigerate the rice and coconut mixture separately, then bring back to
 room temperature by warming at 100 percent power for 1 minute in a
 microwave oven.  The coconut mixture will separate during
 refrigeration, so stir with a fork until smooth.

 Keywords: recipe VEGAN
 Message-ID: <28956F3D.307F@mthvax.cs.miami.edu>



 Basically I do all my jam recipes the same, making variations as I want
 to experiment.

 Crush your berries to the desired texture.  If you want more of the
 fruit integrity, don't crush them very much.  Sprinkle very lightly
 with some sugar so that they will start forming a juice.  Measure 5
 cups of fruit and juice in a non-aluminum heavy pot.  Add 5 cups of


 sugar and mix well.  On a medium to high heat (don't use a real high
 heat as this will scorch the fruit and leave an awful taste in the jam)
 bring the mixture to a good heavy boil.  Remove any scum that forms.

 Add one package dry pectin and stir in well.  Keeping the mixture in a
 good boil, cook until the jam has reached the jelling point.  (I'm at
 work and can't look up the exact temperature--but to test for jelling
 stir down the mixture with a thin spoon such as a metal serving spoon,
 remove and holding the spoon at almost a straight angle down, let the
 jam slide off the spoon.  If the last two or three drops come together
 to form a sheet and sheet off the spoon the jam has reached the jelling
 point.)  Have your sterilized bottles ready along with the lids and
 rings simmering in hot water.

 Pour the jam into the jars, wipe the rims and seal.  The current USDA
 recommendations are to process the jam in a hot water bath for 10
 minutes for pints and to use the two part lids to seal and to not use
 pectin to seal the jars.  If you would rather not use refined sugar in
 your jam, the best bet is to contact your local county extension
 homemaker agent and ask for recipes using honey. I have never tried any
 using honey as I don't want the taste of the honey in the jam, but I
 have been told by friends that you can make very good jams using
 honey.  Sorry I can't tell you how long to boil the mixture as I live
 in the clouds and we have to boil everything longer than those of you

 who live closer to sea level.  Hope this helps.

 This past weekend I also picked more blackberries than a human can
 eat.  I made up this concoction as a sauce for duck (or other poultry),
 and it came out great:

 Put a pint of blackberries in a saucepan, moisten with about 1/3 to 1/2
 Cup of dry red wine.  Add a mashed clove of garlic, a couple of sprigs
 of fresh rosemary, some sugar (6-10 teaspoons, depending on how sour or
 sweet the berries are), and salt to taste.  Bring to a boil, cover, and
 simmer 10 minutes, occasionally stirring and mashing berries against
 side of pan with a spoon.

 Important note:

 This experiment achieved very good marks from my guests, except for one
 problem:  I didn't bother to remove the seeds, and a couple of people
 (myself included) grew tired of the hard seeds interrupting our
 enjoyment of the flavor.  You will probably want to strain the sauce
 somehow when it's done.  Maybe someone who has experience with berries

 and/or food mills and the like could e-mail me a note about how to best
 deal with blackberry seeds!

   I agree.  When looking for a good source of soluble fiber a couple
 of years ago, I decided that they provided the best, low-cost source.
 I have used two recipes of the last couple of years, the first I threw
 together from what was around, and the second I modifed from a Boston

 use a Crok Pot, but a bean pot in the oven at about 300F for 8 hours

 This is a second Indian recipe.  It is an unfailing favorite everywhere
 we make it.  It is a deep-fried appetizer, great with cocktails, and
 for best effect, should be served with a fresh chutney, such as
 coriander leaves ground with fresh ginger, chopped green chilli pepper,
 some yogurt and maybe some mint leaves.

 Cut into matchsticks:
  1 large potato
  1 small eggplant
  1 onion


 There should be about equal amounts of each.

 Mix together about 1/4 cup of white flour with 1/2 cup of chick pea
 flour (called *bessan* and quite a unique thing, which has the aroma

 and aftertaste of sprouted mung beans) and 1/2 tsp salt, some coarsely
 ground black pepper, 1 tsp ground coriander seed, 1 tsp ground cumin,
 and about 1 Tbsp of whole coriander seeds.

 Mix the flours and seeds into the vegetables, sprinkle on a couple of
 Tbsps of water--VERY LITTLE water--and mix together with your hands
 until it just holds together.  It's gooey.

 Fry tablespoons of this mixture in about 3/4 inch of very hot vegetable
 oil until golden brown--about 5 minutes.  Drain and serve hot.

 This comes from a lavish cookbook produced by the New York restaurant
 called The Bombay Palace, and which has sister restaurants in Europe.
 The food at the restaurant is wonderful, but the cookbook, for the most
 part (edited by the food critic Stendal) is a bust.  The recipes do not
 make up well, usually, with some exceptions.  This is one.

 raisins, cranberries, and butter, and cook 5 minutes.  Line piepan with
 pastry and brush with melted butter.  Add filling, and cover top with
 1/2 inch strips of pastry, crisscrossed.  Bake in a very hot oven (450
 degrees F) for 20 minutes.  Makes 1 9-inch pie.

 2 cups sifted flour                   4 to 6 tablespoons cold water
 3/4 teaspoon salt                     2/3 cup shortening

 Sift flour and salt together and cut in shortening with 2 knives or
 pastry blender, until consistency of course meal.  Add the water, using

 only a small portion at a time, until the mixture will hold together.
 Divide the dough into 2 parts.  Roll out on a floured board to desired
 size.  Makes 2 9-inch shells or one 2-crust 9-inch pie.

 (THAMBAYA THI THANAT)


 Make in the summer.  They marinate/pickle in a sunny window for 1+ months.

 From: The Burmese Kitchen by Copeland Marks and Aung Thein

 4 green limes quartered
 2 tsp salt

 2 tbl oil
 1" ginger cut into 4 slices  (candied ginger works nicely)
 1 tbl. white or cider vinegar
 2 tbl. sugar
 1 tbl. paprika
 1 tsp. garam masala
   (spice mixture that can include cinnamon, cloves, cumin, pepper, etc.  See
    Indian cookbook)
 1 tsp. cumin seeds
 2 cloves garlic, sliced

 1) Squeeze 1/2 the juice from each lime.  Mix the lime pieces with 1 tsp. of
 salt and put them in a jar with a tight lid.  Leave in a sunny window for
 4 days.  (I recommend adding something between the jar and it's lid because
 the salt tries to rust the lid.  A piece of plastic or fabric would probably
 work.)  Rotate the jar occassionally (daily) to keep everything mixed up.
 Save the extra lime juice for another purpose.

 2) Add the remaining 1 tsp. salt and mix and let the limes pickle in the
 sunny window for 1-2 months.  turn the jar around to mix everything up every
 couple of days.

 3) Heat the oil, add ginger and stir fry until the ginger is lightly browned.
 Add vingar, limes and the juice from the lime jar.  Mix and cook until the
 vinegar evaporated (2-4 minutes or so).  Add the paprika, garam masala, cumin
 and garlic.  Stir Fry from about 3 more minutes.

 4) Place in a clean jar and cover with a tight lid.  Can store on the shelf
 or will keep indefinitely in the refridgerator.


 5) Serve with a Burmese or Indian meal.

  Indian Flat Bread  (Chapatis)
  -----------------------------

 4 cups wholewheat flour
 2 tsp salt
 2 tbsp ghee  (oil - I use canola)
 1 cup water  ( or a bit more)

 Boil water.  Mix everything together and knead for at least 10 mins.
 (I put it in the mixer and come back later)  It should have enough
 water in it to form a ball.

 Let sit 2 - 6 hours.  The longer it sits, the more air bubbles will be
 in the bread.


 Divide dough into balls the size of walnuts.  Flour a surface then roll
 out the balls as thin as possible.

 Heat (but don't grease) a heavy based frying pan (an electric one works
 well) and fry the rounds for about 1 - 1.5 mins on each side.

 Note:
 This dough can also be used to fill with vegetables and deep fried.

 Take enough cherries to heap into a pie crust.  Cook them (after
 removing seeds) slightly until you have some juice.  Add sugar to taste
 and just enough corn starch to thicken.  Place in pie shell and cover
 with a second shell.  Poke some ventilation holes in top.  Bake at 350F
 until crust is golden brown.

 Good luck.

 I can recommend *New Recipes from Moosewood Restaurant*, on which this
 recipe is based. It's not entirely vegetarian, but quite a few of the

 recipes are vegetarian. It might be an ideal book for someone who's
 trying to cut down on meat. (I am vegan and find it worthwhile.)

 Don't be alarmed by the long list of ingredients! This is pretty easy if you
 get everything measured and/or chopped before you start cooking.

 This recipe is based on the "Mixed Vegetable Curry" from *New Recipes from
 Moosewood Restaurant*, by the Moosewood Collective. The mixed vegetable curry
 is also wonderful, and somewhat less starchy. The spice mix I list here, in
 fact, is identical to the Moosewood recipe.

 I came up with this variation because I wanted to duplicate a favorite dish
 of mine, Alo Chana Massala, which I used to eat at a little Indian restaurant
 on the other coast. With rice, it's a meal in itself, as far as I'm concerned.
 (It has to be, because I learned to cook in a coop of 35 people and I can't
 seem to master cooking for one.)

 But, I digress. "Feeds 4-6" is probably valid if you're using this as a main
 dish. Maybe even more. It's also quite spicy, if you follow my directions
 exactly. (It's spicier if you ignore my directions the way I do!)

 Chickpea and Potato Curry
 =========================

 Ingredients:
  vegetable oil,  4 tablespoons (or "as needed")
  black mustard seeds, 1/2 teaspoon

 (when I make this, I mix up 3 or 4 recipes-worth of the following dry spices
 at a time, so I don't have to measure them out every time I make a curry!)

  cinnamon,  1 teaspoon
  cardamom, ground, 1/2 teaspoon

  cumin, ground,  1 1/2 teaspoon
  coriander, ground, 1 1/2 teaspoon
  fennel seeds, ground, 1/2 teaspoon
  turmeric,   1/2 teaspoon
  cayenne,  1/2 teaspoon
  salt,   1 teaspoon

  garlic, minced,  3 cloves
  ginger root, grated 2 teaspoons

  onion, chopped,  1 large

  chickpeas (garbanzos) 1 cup dry
  potatoes, cubed, 3 cups
  tomatoes, chopped, 2 medium


  water,    1 cup

 Possible Garnishes:
  bananas, shredded coconut, toasted cashews, raisins,
  chutney, etc.

 Serve with: basmati rice (or other appropriate grain)

 Soak the chickpeas overnight (or as you normally do).  Chickpeas from a can
 are fine too, and quicker.

 Heat the oil in a skillet (I start with a couple of tablespoons, then
 add a little more if it gets too dry along the way). Add the mustard
 seeds and heat them until they start to pop.* Add the rest of the
 spices and cook on low for a couple of minutes. Add the onions and
 saute until translucent.**

 Add the potatoes and chickpeas, stir them, and cook a few more minutes. Add
 the water, cover the pan, and simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring
 occasionally.

 The potatoes should be tender but not completely cooked now.  Add the tomatoes,
 stir, and cover for another 10 or 15 minutes.

 Serve with rice and garnish as desired.

 ======
 Notes:

 *   A word to the wise: cover the skillet during this step; those mustard
     seeds can fly! "New Recipes" considers the mustard seeds optional; they
     seem to provide much of the hotness of this recipe.


 **  This is misleading because you've just coated the onions with a
     yellow-brown spice mix, and you're more perceptive than I if you can see
     that they're translucent through all that! You just have to know what
     the _texture_ of translucent onions is like; they will soften and slide
     around more than the raw onions.

 I have couple of recipes with chickpeas and blackeyes peas. Both of
 which can be eaten with steamed rice or flat breads like pita bread or
 chapattis.

 BLACKEYED PEAS
   1/2 medium onion chopped finly
   1 clove garlic minced

   1/4 inch piece ginger minced
   chopped green chilies (to taste)
   1 can blackeyed peas
   1/2 tespoon cumin seeds
   1/2 teaspoon coriander powder
   1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
   1/4 teaspoon garam masala.
   Salt to taste
   Chopped Cilantro for garnish (optional)
   Fresh ground black pepper

   (1) Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet. Add cumin seeds

   (2) After a few seconds add onion, garlic, ginger and green chilies.
   (3) Cook the mixture till it's golden brown
   (4) Add the can of blackeyed peas, all the spices and salt.
   (5) Bring it to a simmer and let it cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes.
   (6) Add cilantro and black pepper before serving
      (Served over a bed of rice)

 SPICY CHICKPEAS
    1 medium onion minced
    2-3 cloves garlic minced
    1/4 inch piece ginger minced
    2-3 green chillies chopped finely (optional)
    2 medium tomatoes pureed
    1 can chickpeas
    1/2 teaspoon garam masala
    1 teaspoon cumin powder
    1 teaspoon coriander powder
    1/4 teaspoon tamrind paste (available in Indian grocery stores)
    1/2 teaspoon chillie powder (optional)
    Salt to taste
    Thinly sliced green onions for garnish (optional)

    (1) Heat 2-3 tablespoon oil
    (2) Add onion, ginger, garlic and green chillie. Cook till they are
        golden brown.
    (3) Add cumin, coriander and chillie powder.
    (4) Add tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes on medium heat
    (5) Add tamrind paste stir till it dissolves.
    (6) Add chickpeas and 1 can of water.
    (7) Cook covered on low heat till the liquid reduces to half.
    (8) Add the salt and garam masala, cook for a few more minutes
    (9) Garnish with green onions before serving.

 Note: Tastes best if the dish is prepared in advance and the chickpeas
 are allowed to absorb all the spices. May need to add a little water if

 the dish gets too thick. Just add a little water and bring the dish to
 a boil.  Dish is similar to the chickpea dish found in most Indian
 Resturants in US.

 Subject: VEGAN: Chinese Pickled Garlic & Lime and Garlic Olives

 I noticed a recent(ish) request for a method of making pickled garlic.

 Here's mine, based on a Sunday colour-supplement recipe of a couple of
 years ago. Rice vinegar is obtainable from oriental stores; don't use
 malt or pickling vinegar, it'll obliterate any other flavour.


 Chinese Pickled Garlic
 - ----------------------

         * 6 heads of young garlic
         * 600ml (1 pint) rice vinegar
         * 1 teaspoon salt

         * 1 tablespoon castor sugar
         * A few dried red chilis
         * 2 teaspoons green peppercorns

 Break up the heads of garlic, and top-and-tail the cloves, but don't
 bother to peel them. Place them in a bowl, and blanch with boiling
 water; leave for a few minutes, then drain.

 Meanwhile, dissolve the salt and sugar in the vinegar. Pack a pint jar
 with the garlic, add peppercorns and chilis, and pour over the vinegar.
 Leave to cool, then seal tightly.

 Notes:
   - Leave for 6 months before trying !!
   - The skin will peel very easily.
   - Don't use unprotected metal lids on your jars (unless you *like*
     aqueous solutions of metal salts..... :-)


 While on the subject of pickles, here's a recipe (from the same source)
 for olives....

 Lime and Garlic Olives
 - ----------------------

         * 225g (8oz) black olives
         * Juice, zest and peel of 3 limes
         * 1 head of garlic

         * 1 tablespoon whole coriander
         * Olive oil

 Drain the olives, and place them into a half-pound pickling jar.
 Roughly grind the coriander and heat in in a few tablespoons of oil for
 a minute. Take the zest of two limes and the peel from the third, and
 add to the oil with the juice of all three limes. Thinly slice the
 garlic, add it to the oil, saute briefly, and pour over the olives.
 Fill with more oil to cover, then seal and leave for a month before
 eating.

 Subject: VEGAN: Chinese Steamed Buns

 For those of you out there that would like to make stuffed, steamed
 buns in a matter of minutes, you can use biscuit dough -- the stuff
 that comes already made into biscuits in round tubes found in the
 refrigerated foods section near the butter, eggs, & cheese.  Pop open
 the tube, take a biscuit, gently flatten it somewhat especially around
 the edges, glob a bit of filling into the center, close the biscuit up
 around the filling, and twist to seal.  Steam in your bamboo steamer
 for 10-20 minutes (depending on the type of filling -- i.e., cooked vs.
 raw meat, veggie, sesame, etc.).

 For the REAL thing, however, here is a dough recipe adapted from Madame
 Wong's Long Life Chinese Cookbook:

  -------------------
  Buns (Basic Recipe)
  -------------------

 1 package dried yeast or 1 cake fresh yeast
 1 cup lukewarm water
 4 1/2 cups flour
 1/4 cup sugar
 2 tablespoons Crisco or vegetable oil
 1/2 cup boiling water
 2 tablespoons sesame oil (dark Oriental kind)

 Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water.  Add 1 cup of flour.  Mix
 thoroughly.  cover with cloth.  Let rise 1 hour, until bubbles appear.

 Dissolve sugar and vegetable oil in 1/2 cup boiling water.  Stir well.
 Cool until lukewarm.  Pour into yeast mixture.  Add 3 1/3 cups flour.

 Knead dough on lightly floured board until smooth.  Put into extra

 large greased bowl in a warm place.  cover with damp cloth.  Let rise
 until double in bulk, about 2 hours.

 Divide into 2 portions.  Remove first portion and knead 2 minutes.
 Repeat with second.  Roll each into a roll 12 inches long and 2 inches
 wide.  Cut into 12 pieces (24 total).

 Flatten each piece with palm of hand.  Roll with rolling pin into
 3-inch circles.


 Brush with sesame oil.  Indent middle of circle with chopstick.  (At
 this point, add filling if desired.)

 Close dough around filling (if using); otherwise fold circle in half so
 that it becomes a half moon then crimp edges tightly with a fork.

 Place each bun on separate square piece of foil (or waxed paper) on
 steamer tray.  Cover tray with towel.  Let buns rise to double in bulk,
 about 30 minutes.  Remove towel.

 Steam tightly covered over briskly boiling water for 10 minutes.

 (May be prepared in advance.  May be frozen.  Thaw out in plastic bag
 and re-steam 10 minutes.)

 Keywords: recipe vegan/coconut-rice


 Hi!

 I saw your posting and I know of a South-Indian dish, very traditional

 sort of fitting your description, that is called Coconut rice.

 Recipe follows:

 1) Making of seasoning powder:

 First take about 10-15 red chillies, a teaspoon of Thania(Celantro)
 seeds, Channa dal ( I am sorry that all names are Indian, you can
 probably get these in any Indian Grocery store) and fry them in a pan
 with very little oil. Add some Asfotedia for aroma. Put about 2 table
 spoons of channa dal.( I forgot the quantity earlier). Then grind them
 coarsely on a blender, remember the channa dal should not be in whole
 pieces.) Keep this aside for garnishing.


 2) Take a freshly broken coconut and grate them up for about 2 cups.

 3) Cook white rice in a cooker, add less water than actually written in
 the instructions. Cook about 4 cups of it, add 6 cups of water to it. I
 prefer Adolphus brand Long Grain white rice.

 4) In a frying pan put about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and heat

 it.  Put some mustard seeds and let it burst, then add a little
 turmeric powder.  To this add 1 teaspoon of Channa Dal and Urad Dal and
 fry till golden yellow.  Add some finely split red chillies and green
 chillies as required.  Then add in the grated coconut and stir for
 about 10 secs. Then add the rice to this mixture away from the fire and
 mix thoroughly. Add salt to taste.  Add 2 teaspoons of seasoning
 mixture to the rice and stir.  If you could lay your hands on some
 coconut oil add a teaspoonful for aroma.  Garnish with some freshly cut
 Celantro leaves and some bay leaves.

 5) This is ready to be served with chips or pickle as side dish.  Or
 you can make come chatni by grinding finely some coconut with green
 chillies and celantro with water for consistency. Add salt to taste.


 PS:
 Add 1 teaspoon of chilli powder when frying the items if you could not make
 the seasoning powder.
 Reduce the number of chillies used if you want it to be less hot.
 Reduce the amount of oil initially while frying if you want it less fattening.


 Try this recipe and let me know the results.

 Bye.

    I make a strawberry/banana pie thats very simple.

  2 Bananas sliced
  1 1/2 qt strawberries sliced
 (reserve at least 2 of the biggest ones for garnish)
  Graham cracker crust
  Strawberry Glaze

 To save time I usually buy the crust and the glaze.  But you can get
 the recipe for the crust off the back of a graham cracker box.  As far
 as the glaze goes maybe someone on the net has a recipe for this.  I
 just find it easier to use it from the store.  It's mostly made of
 sugar. It can usually be found next to the Strawberries.

  Start with the bananas and layer them on the bottom, then layer the
 strawberries on top.  Continue doing this until the pie is full.

  Pour the glaze on top so it covers the pie and the fruit on the bottom
 is covered.  For a small pie just 1 jar of glaze for a large one 2.

   Refrigerate for 5-6 hours. Garnish with the strawberries and serve
 with whipped cream.

     Variation:

    Add sliced Kiwi as a third layer.

   It is a very refreshing summer treat!

 I don't know if it's German, but one of my favorite cucumber salads is

 to take thinly sliced cucumbers and onions (separate into rings) and
 let them sit in a "dressing" of vinegar (plain old white vinegar), some
 water, and a pinch of sugar. (No, no amounts. As long as there's enough
 to cover all the cucumbers and onions.) Let sit an indefinite amount of
 time in the refrigerator, from 10 minutes to overnight. Enjoy.

 This is supposed to be on the very sour side.

 I don't know how close this will be to what you ate at your friend's
 party, but this is what I make and eat as dahl.  Cheap, and good too!

 Dahl

 2 tsp tumeric
 1 tsp cayanne
 2 tsp paprika
 1 tbsp cumin
 1 cup red lentils, washed
 1 medium onion, chopped fine
 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
 oil

 Boil lentils in water with tumeric, cayanne, and paprika.  Meantime,
 sautee onions and garlic in more oil than necessary, stir in cumin.
 Add to lentil mixture, cook to a thick paste.  Serve warm or cold with
 a flat bread, like pita, tortillas, or lavash.

 Note:  you may want to adjust the spices depending on how hot you like
 your food (e.g. 1 tsp cayanne may be too hot, I usually use ~ 1/2
 tsp).  I've also seen other recipes for this, in places like the
 Moosewood cookbooks, which call for coconut milk and a few different
 things.  Enjoy...

 Here is an additional recipe for Dahl, which I feel obliged to share
 with you all since several people tell me it is the best dahl they have
 ever had.  Anyway....

 Ingredients:  1.5 cups masoor dahl (orange in colour).
   Vegetable oil
   3 dried red peppers

    1 tsp mustard seed   (tsp = teaspoon)
   0.25 tsp asafoetida
   1 medium onion
   1.5 tsp coriander powder
   0.5 tsp turmeric powder
   salt to taste.

 Put dahl in about 3 cups water and let boil. It normally takes about an
 hour for the dahl to break up and pulp, however what I do is to start
 soaking it in water before I leave for work. This way it takes much
 less time to cook when boiled later. (gas, electricity SAVINGS!!)

 Spice Mixture: (To be added when dahl is about 80% cooked or even
 earlier if you like) Slice the onion into thin slices. Heat the oil in
 a frying pan, when hot, add red chilies and mustard seeds. After seeds
 pop, add the asafoetida, and immediately turn down the heat. Add the
 onions, start frying on low heat until they are "transparent", then
 turn up heat until they are quite brown, but not burnt black. Add
 coriander & turmeric and turn down heat. After a minute, add about 0.5
 cup of the boiling dahl mixture to the frying pan and stir
 energetically so that the spice mixture gets mixed well, and onions
 break up.


 Pour it back into the dahl pot, add salt, cook for another 10 minutes
 or until dahl is done, whichever comes later.

 Eat with rice, and tastes good with Patak's Garlic Pickle or Patak's
 Prawn Balichow on the side.

       Enjoy,
       Mr. Patak. (just kidding).

    I bought a bag of lentils and don't know what to do with them.  Can
    anyone suggest some easy recipes, preferably something with curry?


 One of my favorite lentil dishes is Dahl, I boil equal amounts of brown
 rice and (green) lentils with 2.5 times as much water, an onion, and
 whatever spices I feel like (curry is especially good) for ~45mins.
 This is good served hot with some steamed veggies or as a bases of a
 non-meat loaf.  If you have red lentils I would suggest using white
 rice since the cooking times would match better.

 I also use lentils homemade soups since they don't have to be soaked
 overnight.

 Here are two basic recipes:

 Basic cooked dal
 ================

 Use about 1/2 cup dal per person; you can make lots and freeze some.
 Spread dal on a dishtowel and sort over for pebbles.  Some imported dal
 is really dirty.  Place in colander and rinse well.  Set in a bowl of
 water to soak for at least half an hour or as long as overnight.

 Saute chopped onion in some oil; use about 1/2 - 1 onion per cup of
 dal.  Add finely grated ginger (1 tsp or more per cup of dal) and
 pressed or chopped garlic (at least 4 cloves per cup of dal--I use
 more). Saute about one minute, then add dal, some tumeric, some salt,
 and lots of water.  Simmer until dal is very tender--cooking time will
 vary.  The resulting mixture should have the thickness of thick, lumpy
 gravy (sounds yummy, huh?).  If you like, after the dal is all cooked,
 add a *tiny* amount of tamarind concentrate.

 The dal is, and is supposed to be, not all that spicy.  It usually
 accompanies a spicier dish.  For simplicity, you can serve it with just
 spicy pickles and rice.


 Achar (peppered radish)
 =======================

 Ingredients:
 Daikon radish
 cooking oil
 salt
 tamarind
 yellow mustard seeds
 cumin seeds
 tumeric
 red pepper (cayenne or crushed red pepper)

 Wash daikon radish and cut into big french-fry shapes.  In a large pan,
 heat a small amount of oil. When hot, add a couple of tablespoons of
 yellow mustard seeds.  These will start to crackle and pop.  Let them

 pop for about 30 seconds, and then add a couple of teaspoons of cumin
 seeds.  These will crackle too; watch carefully to see that they don't
 burn.  Lower heat slightly and add radish, a sprinkling of tumeric, a
 very small amount of water, a dash of red pepper, a little salt, and
 quite a bit of tamarind.  I use about a tablespoon for a couple of
 pounds of radish--we make this in quantity.  Stir until ingredients are
 well mixed.  Cook until radish is just heated, but still very crisp.
 Radish should not be limp or soggy.  Serve hot or cold.  Yes, you eat
 the seeds, too.

 My husband says you can make potatoes this way too, but the potatoes
 need to be cooked all the way through.  I would pre-cook them in the
 microwave to speed things up.


 I selected these recipes because I think the techniques and spicing
 fairly are representative.  The cook-seeds-in-oil trick is common, as
 is the garlic-onions-ginger mixture.

 Don't be shy with the spices, but be aware that black pepper gets
 hotter as it cooks longer, and too much tumeric can make food bitter.

 Lastly, here is a great recipe for salsa sauce which I got from a
 Californian friend of mine (Lynne Deal) recently.

                        DEAL'S CALIFORNIAN SALSA
                       --------------------------


 4 *large* tomatoes - *ripe*, peeled, seeded + chopped (see below)
 1 tablespoon seeded, finely chopped *hot* peppers
 2 tablespoon finely chopped fresh cilantro
 1 small red onion, finely chopped
 1 large clove garlic, finely chopped
 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar (or lemon juice)
 1 teaspoon salt

 To peel tomatoes, immerse in boiling water for *less* than 1 minute,
 then plunge into ice water and the skin will slip off. Squeeze out seeds,
 chop.

 Balance of ingredients is according to taste, especially the chilis. Try
 *lots* of cilantro and garlic and add chopped red and green sweet peppers.

 Keywords: recipe vegan/dianes-eggplant


 Here's a recipe that takes some time, but well worth the effort.

 1/2 bushel of hot red peppers
 1/2 bushel of red and green sweet peppers
 1 head garlic (that is the entire head, not one clove and use a very large
 head)
 fresh mint--about a good colandar full--washed and leaves removed from the
 stem
 olive oil
 approximately 1/2 bushel medium to medium large eggplants

 clean and seed the peppers.  clean the paper from the garlic.  wash the
 mint.  remove the leaves from the stems.  Pass the peppers, garlic and
 mint through a meat grinder on medium fine grind.  Set aside.  *they
 will begin to form juice which you should drain before using*.  This


 can be done a day ahead before using and then refrigerated or you can
 do this right before using the mixture.

 wash the eggplants, remove the stem and blossom ends then slice into
 1/2" slices.  Alternately layer the slices of eggplant and canning salt
 on a large drain board--either one with holes in it or one that
 slightly slants.  You don't need too much salt--just sprinkle a little
 bit on each slice.  Then place a large board on top-- large enough to
 cover all the layers of eggplant and place a heavy on top of the board.
 I use an 8 quart pot filled with water.  The eggplants will begin to
 *weep*.  Let them sit like this overnight or about 24 hours.  Remove
 the weight and the board--the eggplants should be pressed thin.  Use a
 paper towel wipe off the excess moisture and salt.

 In a heavy pan, lightly fry each slice in the olive oil.  Don't use too
 much as the eggplant really absorbs the oil.

 In a heavy crock make alternate layers of fried eggplant slices and the
 pepper mixture.  When the crock is about 3/4 full, cover all with a
 good virgin or extra virgin olive oil.  Cover with a lid that will fit
 inside the crock and set a weight on the lid so that a little oil comes
 over the lid.  Store in a cool dark place and they will be ready to eat
 in a few weeks.

 If you would rather not store them in a crock, then alternate the
 layers of eggplant and pepper mixture as before but in a baking dish.
 Place two stacks of eggplants/pepper in a small freezer bag and some

 extra pepper mixture and freeze.  To serve, take them out of the
 freezer about 4-5 hours before using.  Gently pull the pieces apart as
 they thaw.  Then cover with olive oil and a little garlic salt or salt
 and peppers to taste.  They will absorb more oil as they sit.  Add more
 if you wish.

 These are great.  They are tangy but not hot, even when we have used
 peppers that actually caused blisters on our hands when cleaning them.
 They're great as a meat condiment, part of a relish try, mixed with
 tomato slices and used as a salad.  My husband and I like to make
 sandwiches with them and some salami.  If you are looking for a
 different taste, use cider vinegar instead of the olive oil to cover
 the eggplant as this slightly pickles them.  When ready to serve drain
 however many slices you want to use then mix them will a small amount
 of olive oil and some seasonings.  A great salad.

 I'm sorry I'm so vague about how much oil to use or how much mint.  this is
 a very old family recipe, my great-grandmother made these and I'm well over
 40.  We really eyeball the amounts and adjust the garlic and mint according
 to how strong they are.

 I hope you enjoy

 Subject: VEGAN: Dosai
 Keywords: recipe vegan dosai


 (Verbose, designed to guide the novice through the steps).


 Dosai (South Indian, Pancake-like)
 =====


 Ingredients:

 3 cups of Texas long grain rice
 1 cup of urad dal (available in Indian grocery stores).
    (Buy the polished kind, not the unpolished one with the outer black layer)
 salt to taste (about 2 tsp)

 Method:

 GRINDING:

 Soak the rice and the dal separately, for about 5 hours (soaking longer
 won't hurt, I usually soak it in the morning, go off to work, and grind
 in the evening.) Grind the rice with sufficient water until it is a
 smooth paste. (I use my osterizer and run it in 3 batches, the amount
 of water used to grind is somewhat crucial, using too much will make
 the result too watery, while using too little will make it hard to
 grind and too thick. I usually put in the rice and add water until it
 just reaches the brim of the rice, this will seem like too much, but it
 will work out fine once the rice is ground.  I then run the osterizer
 on MIX until the rice is broken and then run it on LIQUIDIZE until the
 rice starts to become a paste.  If required, add just a little more
 water, perhaps a few tablespoons.  Touch the paste between your fingers
 to feel the texture. It should be smooth).

 Now grind the dal in two batches. (The amount of water here is not as
 tricky. Traditionally this would be ground in a stone grinder by hand.
 The dal needs to be ground while slowly adding more water from the top
 of the osterizer. When ground, the dal has the tendency to fluff up,
 this tendency must be encouraged by adding only a little water at a

 time while stirring and continuing to grind.  The dal should double in
 quantity after grinding, while the quantity of rice would have remained
 unchanged.) Now mix both the pastes with the salt in a dish that is at
 least a third bigger in size, allowing space for the dough to rise.
 (Quite commonly, the dough runs over for me, so I put it in a larger
 dish than worry all night about overflowing dough).  Leave for about 8
 hours in a dark warm place. I usually leave it in the oven overnight
 and occasionally turn the oven on for a minute or two, to keep the air
 inside the oven at a warm temperature.

 COOKING:

 The next morning, if you have done all this, the dough is ready to be
 transformed into dosas. Use a heavy cast-iron griddle (a flat non-stick
 pan will do, but sadly lacks the taste that comes from the iron pan).
 Heat the pan until a few drops of water dropped on the pan sizzles away
 Take a deep ladle full of dough and drop the dough in the middle of the
 pan, then with a deftness that comes with practice, quickly swirl the
 dough away from the middle until it is spread evenly in a circle around
 the pan. You must do this quickly because once the dough cooks, you
 cannot spread it and the result will be lumpy.  Take a teaspoon full of
 oil and spread it around the edge of the dosai.  Wait a minute or so,
 until you see the edges browning and insert a flat ladle that has sharp
 edges under and all around the dosai, until it is released completely

 (Bewarned that, using a well-scrubbed pan won't let you release the
 dosai easily. To prevent this, you might want to rub a little oil onto

 the surface of the pan before spreading the dough.)

 After releasing the dosai, flip it around on the other side and put
 another teaspoon of oil around the edges. Wait a minute or two until
 it is cooked and remove from the pan.

 Before making the next one, use a small piece of paper kitchen towel
 and rub any excess oil off the pan.

 (This whole procedure sounds tedious, but its not too hard after you've
 done it a few times. Incidentally I make dosa every week. The dough
 will keep in the refrigerator for a week or more.  If the dough starts
 to get sour, cut small pieces some green chilis and onion and add to
 the dough before cooking it.  This can be done even otherwise, for a
 different flavor and variety.)

 To eat:

 Break a piece of the dosa and dip it into the dosa-molaga-podi
 or the samber (recipes to follow) and pop it into youir mouth.


 Enjoy. If you do try to make this, send me email if you have any
 further questions.

 Subject: VEGAN: Dosai Molaga Podi
 Keywords: recipe vegan dosai molaga podi


 A powdery substance that is traditionally eaten with dosai or idlis.

 Dosai Molaga podi (Literally translated, "Dosai Chili Powder")

 =================

 Ingredients:

 1/2 cup urad dal
 1/2 cup chana dal
 asafoetida (a little)
 tamarind (dry or fry it also) (cannot use the paste)
 1/4 cup coriander seeds to taste ( I found 1/4 cup a little too much,
                                    reduce slightly)
 jaggery (little bit) (molasses?)
 salt (to taste)
 red chillies (to desired taste)
 1/4 cup sesame seed (preferable the white kind)

 Method:

 Fry til in a dry pan, and the others in a little oil separately, until
 red (don't wait until it gets too dark).  Powder all ingredients finely
 and the two dals slightly coarsely and mix all together.  Note on the
 amount of red chilies to use-- I usually fry and grind red chilis
 separately (this needs to be done with sufficient ventilation in the
 kitchen), and then keep adding this to the mixture of the other

 ingredients until desired level of heat tolerance.  I can always use
 any leftover in other recipes that calls for red chili powder.

 Note: This makes a batch that you can keep around for a few months.
       Store in normal air-tight glass bottle or plastic container.

 How to eat the dosai with this:

 Add a little oil to a little podi and mix, the dosa in then dipped into
 this oil-podi mixture, to smear it with this mixture and then popped
 into the mouth. Using the fingers is the preferred way here.  (This is
 not unlike the way the Ethiopian bread Injera is eaten).
