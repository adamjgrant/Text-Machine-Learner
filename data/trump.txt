Sep 10, 2016 08:14:10 PM The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits! [Twitter for Android]  link

Sep 10, 2016 10:54:27 AM Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER! [Twitter for Android]  link
Sep 10, 2016 07:47:18 AM Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls! [Twitter for Android]  link

Sep 10, 2016 12:57:59 AM I havn't seen @tonyschwartz in many years, he hardly knows me. Never liked his style. Super lib, Crooked H supporter. Irrelevant dope! [Twitter for Android]  link
Sep 10, 2016 12:47:11 AM Dummy writer @tonyschwartz, who wanted to do a second book with me for years (I said no), is now a hostile basket case who feels jilted! [Twitter for Android]  link

Sep 9, 2016 12:32:36 PM Henry McMaster, Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me, beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers, so badly. Funny! [Twitter Web Client]  link
Sep 9, 2016 09:42:56 AM Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN. [Twitter Web Client]  link
Sep 9, 2016 09:37:53 AM .@CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign. [Twitter Web Client]  link
Sep 8, 2016 11:10:49 PM The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke! [Twitter for Android]  link

Sep 8, 2016 07:39:36 PM It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail. [Twitter for iPad]  link

Sep 8, 2016 01:17:01 PM With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted. [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Sep 8, 2016 01:16:25 PM Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto. [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Sep 8, 2016 11:25:36 AM Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS. [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Sep 8, 2016 10:17:47 AM Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media! [Twitter Web Client]  link

Sep 5, 2016 08:49:00 AM President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals! [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Sep 4, 2016 06:49:48 PM Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening? [Twitter for Android]  link

Sep 4, 2016 06:05:24 PM The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad! [Twitter for Android]  link

Sep 4, 2016 11:04:21 AM Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term! [Twitter for Android]  link
Sep 4, 2016 07:55:58 AM Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source [Twitter for Android]  link
Sep 3, 2016 03:36:39 PM .@CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals. [Twitter for Android]  link
Sep 3, 2016 03:33:36 PM Great visit to Detroit church, fantastic reception, and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd! [Twitter for Android]  link

Jul 29, 2016 09:14:25 AM Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign." Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 29, 2016 09:06:38 AM If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town! #NeverHillary [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 29, 2016 08:59:42 AM "Little" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 29, 2016 08:53:31 AM General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD #NeverHillary [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 29, 2016 08:44:54 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications! [Twitter for Android]  link

Jul 29, 2016 07:51:13 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 29, 2016 07:40:10 AM The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD! [Twitter for Android]  link

Jul 28, 2016 10:50:59 PM Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jul 28, 2016 10:47:56 PM Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country. [Twitter for iPhone]  link

Jul 27, 2016 08:01:03 AM Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 27, 2016 07:57:20 AM Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 27, 2016 05:08:35 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 27, 2016 05:01:39 AM Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 27, 2016 04:50:55 AM The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 27, 2016 04:43:16 AM Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 27, 2016 04:33:52 AM As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 26, 2016 10:01:04 PM Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. https://t.co/eoNTWK6I8y [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jul 26, 2016 09:11:47 PM Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep? [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 26, 2016 09:08:50 PM I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 26, 2016 09:02:24 PM No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated! [Twitter for Android]  link

Jul 26, 2016 05:47:28 PM In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 26, 2016 02:48:08 PM Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here. [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jul 26, 2016 02:27:58 PM Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed! [Twitter for iPhone]  link

Jul 26, 2016 07:38:27 AM Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 26, 2016 07:34:19 AM Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 25, 2016 10:19:38 PM Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time. [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 25, 2016 10:12:57 PM Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 25, 2016 10:04:56 PM Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jul 25, 2016 09:14:29 PM If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself. [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jul 25, 2016 04:57:14 PM I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 25, 2016 04:45:54 PM Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 25, 2016 04:33:49 PM While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jul 25, 2016 04:32:59 PM Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War. [Twitter for iPhone]  link

Jul 25, 2016 09:01:25 AM The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 25, 2016 08:47:45 AM Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 25, 2016 08:42:55 AM Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 25, 2016 08:19:18 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie. [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 25, 2016 07:27:35 AM If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 25, 2016 07:26:56 AM Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam [Twitter for iPad]  link
Jul 25, 2016 07:02:01 AM Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 25, 2016 06:57:17 AM How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 25, 2016 06:31:22 AM The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 06:59:10 PM Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 06:47:08 PM The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 05:33:42 PM The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 05:16:59 PM The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 05:07:49 PM Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 05:02:42 PM Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 04:53:29 PM If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 03:45:31 PM The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 03:30:06 PM I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 03:20:57 PM Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.) [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jul 24, 2016 08:30:59 AM Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 08:27:56 AM There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 07:30:15 AM An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates. [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 07:15:51 AM Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 06:56:43 AM Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 06:25:06 AM Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 06:16:15 AM The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H! [Twitter for Android]  link

Jul 23, 2016 04:20:58 PM The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud! [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jul 23, 2016 03:43:33 PM Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 23, 2016 11:06:15 AM I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 23, 2016 10:36:41 AM Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 23, 2016 10:01:48 AM Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 23, 2016 09:51:32 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA. [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 23, 2016 05:55:20 AM Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 23, 2016 05:42:10 AM Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 23, 2016 05:35:37 AM Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 23, 2016 05:31:18 AM The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight? [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 22, 2016 10:49:04 PM I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam. [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 22, 2016 10:23:15 PM Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did? [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 22, 2016 06:03:19 PM Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich. [Twitter for Android]  link

Feb 3, 2016 09:28:59 AM Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. [Twitter for Android]  link
Feb 3, 2016 09:21:03 AM And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie! [Twitter for Android]  link
Feb 3, 2016 09:10:53 AM The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud [Twitter for Android]  link
Feb 3, 2016 09:07:25 AM Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. [Twitter for Android]  link
Feb 3, 2016 08:56:48 AM During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. [Twitter for Android]  link
Feb 3, 2016 08:47:33 AM Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! [Twitter for Android]  link

Jan 31, 2016 09:32:03 AM By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS. [Twitter for Android]  link
