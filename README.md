# Text-Machine-Learner
Simple python script to generate text based on machine-learned input text

## Setup
Follow the instructions [here](https://chunml.github.io/ChunML.github.io/tutorial/Setting-Up-Python-Environment-For-Computer-Vision-And-Machine-Learning/) first.
Linux required. I highly recommend installing this on a fresh installation of Ubuntu.
Extra recommendation: Just create a droplet in DigitalOcean and make a snapshot of your setup for when you want to run it.
I'll also show you how to run this script without having to be logged into the droplet.
